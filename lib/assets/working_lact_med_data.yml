Since only extensive application of the most potent corticosteroids may cause systemic effects in the mother, it is unlikely that short-term application of topical corticosteroids would pose a risk to the breastfed infant by passage into breastmilk. However, it would be prudent to use the least potent drug on the smallest area of skin possible. It is particularly important to ensure that the infant's skin does not come into direct contact with the areas of skin that have been treated. Only the lower potency corticosteroids should be used on the nipple or areola where the infant could directly ingest the drugs from the skin. Only water-miscible cream or gel products should be applied to the breast because ointments may expose the infant to high levels of mineral paraffins via licking.[1] Any topical corticosteroid should be wiped off thoroughly prior to nursing if it is being applied to the breast or nipple area."

Newborn infants apparently absorb small amounts of other aminoglycosides, but serum levels with typical three times daily dosages are far below those attained when treating newborn infections and systemic effects of amikacin are unlikely. Older infants would be expected to absorb even less amikacin. Because there is little variability in the milk amikacin levels during multiple daily dose regimens, timing breastfeeding with respect to the dose is of little or no benefit in reducing infant exposure.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "An expert panel considers use of aminophylline to be acceptable during breastfeeding.[1] Maternal aminophylline use may occasionally cause stimulation and irritability and fretful sleep in infants. Newborn and especially preterm infants are most likely to be affected because of their slow elimination and low serum protein binding of theophylline. There is no need to avoid aminophylline products; however, keep maternal serum theophylline concentrations in the lower part of the therapeutic range and monitor the infant for signs of theophylline side effects. Infant serum theophylline concentrations can help to determine if signs of agitation are due to theophylline. Avoiding breastfeeding for 2 hours after intravenous or 4 hours after an immediate-release oral aminophylline product can decrease the dose received by the breastfed infant."
    drug_levels: "Aminophylline is a salt of theophylline, which is the active drug found in maternal serum and breastmilk after aminophylline ingestion. Maternal Levels. Theophylline rapidly equilibrates between plasma and milk. Peak milk levels occur 1 to 3 hours after oral ingestion of immediate-release products and almost immediately after intravenous administration. Milk levels parallel serum levels closely and average about 70% of simultaneous maternal serum levels.[2][3] Assuming that each 1 mg/kg of maternal theophylline increases her serum level by 2 mg/L, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 21% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of theophylline or 17% of the maternal dosage of aminophyllline. Infant Levels. Theophylline is found in the serum of breastfed infants[4] In newborn infants with typical theophylline clearance rates, infant serum levels are expected to be between 1 and 4 mg/L with a maternal serum level in the therapeutic range of 10 to 20 mg/L.[2] Infant serum levels might occasionally accumulation to therapeutic levels in infants with slow clearance rates of the drug.[5]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Irritability and fretful sleeping occurred in a 3-day-old breastfed infant on days of maternal aminophylline intake of 200 mg every six hours. These effects ceased with discontinuation and recurred on rechallenge over the next 9 months. These effects were probably caused by theophylline in breastmilk. Another five infants reported in this paper showed no adverse reactions after maternal theophylline ingestion.[3] Accumulation of theophylline in infant serum appears most likely in neonates and premature infants because they eliminate theophylline slowly.[2][5]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Breastmilk and infant serum levels of amiodarone and its active metabolite are somewhat unpredictable, but can be high during breastfeeding. The infant receives an estimated dose of amiodarone plus desethylamiodarone ranging from 3.5 to 45% of the mother's weight-adjusted amiodarone dose, with a median dose of about 11%.[1][2][3][4] Infant serum levels of the drug plus metabolite range from 14 to 74% of simultaneous     Maternal Levels: with the higher values reflecting transplacental passage of the drug.[2][3][4] In addition to possible cardiac effects, these compounds contain a large amount of iodine which may be released during metabolism. Thyroid dysfunction was reported in one breastfed infant. Even if the drug were discontinued at birth, the mother would continue to excrete amiodarone and its metabolite (and possibly large amounts of iodine) into breastmilk for days to weeks.<br><br>Some investigators believe that breastfeeding can be undertaken during maternal amiodarone use with periodic monitoring of infant cardiac and thyroid function status,[5][6] especially if only a single dose of amiodarone is given.[7] Infant serum levels of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone may be useful for ruling out cardiac effects of the drug. If hypothyroidism develops, therapy should be promptly initiated."
    drug_levels: "Amiodarone is an iodine-containing compound that is active and is also metabolized to the active metabolite desethylamiodarone. Metabolism also releases 6 mg of free iodine for each 100 mg of amiodarone which can affect thyroid function. The drug has an exceptionally long half-life of 100 days in adults because of extensive storage in body fat. It requires weeks to months to attain steady state and to be cleared from the body.[6] Maternal Levels: After having taken amiodarone 200 mg twice daily 5 days weekly for 4 years, the milk of a mother was completely expressed 4 times during the first 2 days postpartum. The average milk amiodarone concentration was 3.5 mg/L. The authors calculated that her infant would have received an average of 18% and a maximum of 26% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of amiodarone.[8]A woman who took amiodarone with reducing doses of 600, 400 and 200 mg daily for one week at each dosage level during the last 3 weeks of pregnancy had milk amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels of 0.5 to 1.8 mg/L and 0.4 to 0.8 mg/L, respectively, in 5 samples of colostrum obtained during days 2 and 3 postpartum.[1]In a mother who took amiodarone 200 mg daily for the last 5 weeks of pregnancy and for one week after delivery, milk amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels were 0.55 and 0.44 mg/L, respectively, at 4 weeks postpartum and 0.030 and 0.002 mg/L at 6 weeks postpartum.[4]A mother who took amiodarone 200 mg daily throughout pregnancy and during breastfeeding had milk amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels of 1.7 and 0.75 mg/L, respectively, 2 weeks postpartum and 3.0 and 1.8 mg/L 3 weeks postpartum.[4]Another mother who took amiodarone 200 mg daily throughout pregnancy had milk amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels of 2.2 and 0.77 mg/L, respectively, at birth. Her infant was breastfed, but no infant serum levels were measured.[4]A woman who took amiodarone 400 mg daily from week 14 of pregnancy and throughout nursing had milk amiodarone levels that varied from 1.06 to 3.65 mg/L (average 2.52 mg/L) and milk desethylamiodarone levels that varied from 0.5 to 1.24 mg/L (average 0.9 mg/L) on 5 occasions during the month following delivery. Her breastfed infant's thyroid function tests remained normal.[3]A woman who took amiodarone 800 mg daily for 1 week starting at week 34 of pregnancy, then 400 mg daily for the rest of her pregnancy and during breastfeeding had milk amiodarone levels that varied from 3.6 to 14.4 mg/L (average 10.4 mg/L) and milk desethylamiodarone levels that varied from 1.3 to 5.7 mg/L (average 4.1 mg/L) on days 9, 11 and 13 postpartum.[2]A woman took amiodarone 200 mg three times daily for 11 days, then 200 mg twice daily during her pregnancy. She discontinued the drug at the time of delivery and breastfed her infant. The milk amiodarone level was 0.6 mg/L on day 5 and increased to 2.1 mg/L on day 11. The increase between days 5 and 11 could have been due to sampling times (fore- vs hindmilk) or because of an increase in fat content as lactation progressed. Amiodarone was undetectable in milk by day 25.[9] Infant Levels: A mother took amiodarone 200 mg daily throughout pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Her breastfed infant had serum amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels of 30 and 320 mcg/L (4.5 and 51% of maternal plasma levels), respectively, at 3 weeks postpartum.[4]A mother took amiodarone 200 mg daily for the last 5 weeks of pregnancy and for one week after delivery. At 4 weeks postpartum the breastfed infant's plasma amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels were 10 and 160 mcg/L, respectively At 6 weeks postpartum, her breastfed infant's drug and metabolite plasma levels were 10 and 30 mcg/L.[3]A woman took amiodarone 400 mg daily from week 14 of pregnancy and throughout nursing. Her breastfed infant's serum amiodarone and desethylamiodarone levels were 200 and 50 mcg/L (60% and 14% of     Maternal Levels:, respectively, at one day of age and undetectable (  < 100 and   < 50 mcg/L, respectively) at 1 and 2 weeks of age.[4]A woman took amiodarone 800 mg daily for 1 week starting at week 34 of pregnancy, then 400 mg daily for the rest of her pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Her breastfed infant's serum amiodarone level remained constant at 400 mcg/L (about 25% of maternal serum levels) during the first 9 weeks of life, while desethylamiodarone levels slowly decreased from 0.3 (22% of maternal serum levels) to 150 mcg/L (10% of maternal serum levels) during the same time period.[2]One group reported amiodarone breastmilk levels in 2 patients. The first mother received a total of 7.6 grams of amiodarone over the first 7 days postpartum for ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. She collected breastmilk samples between days 10 and 18 postpartum. Back-extrapolation of the sample values indicated an initial amiodarone concentration of 24.8 mg/L that fell with a half-life of 4.4 days. The second patient received a single amiodarone dose of 150 mg intravenously on day 1 postpartum. Breastmilk samples collected on  days 4 and 5 postpartum contained amiodarone 0.19 mg/L and 0.17 mg/L, and desethylamiodarone, 0.084 mg/L and 0.085 mg/L, respectively. The authors concluded that breastmilk cessation is probably not necessary after a single dose of 150 mg.[7]In summary, from these limited number of case reports, the infant receives an estimated dose of amiodarone plus desethylamiodarone ranging from 3.5 to 45% of the mother's weight-adjusted amiodarone dose, with a median dose of about 11%.[1][2][3][4] Infant serum levels of the drug plus metabolite range from 14 to 74% of simultaneous     Maternal Levels: with the higher values reflecting transplacental passage of the drug.[2][3][4] There are no reports on the amount of free iodine excreted into breastmilk during amiodarone use."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Five infants who breastfed without apparent harm during maternal amiodarone therapy have been reported.[2][3][4][9] One mother took amiodarone during the last 5 weeks of pregnancy and until one week after delivery. She was also taking metoprolol throughout pregnancy and at the time of delivery. Possible signs of hypothyroidism occurred transiently in her breastfed infant at 9 and 24 days of age. This was possibly caused by amiodarone or iodine from amiodarone in breastmilk, although residual amiodarone from transplacental passage is also a possible contributing factor; no abnormalities in cornea or the lungs were found.[4]"

Weight change and the development of jaundice were also recorded. No statistical differences in these parameters were found between the infants of the control mothers and those of the 14 mothers taking amoxicillin-clavulanate.[2]A prospective, controlled study asked mothers who called an information service about adverse reactions experience by their breastfed infants. Mothers were taking either amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Overall, adverse reactions in the infants were statistically more frequent in the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid group (22.3%) than in the amoxicillin group (7.5%) and the rate of adverse effects was dose-related. Amoxicillin-clavulanate reactions consisted of restlessness (8.9%), diarrhea (5.9%), rash (5.9%), and constipation (1.5%), although no single adverse effect was statistically more frequent than in the amoxicillin group.

No rashes or candidiasis were reported among the exposed infants.[3] 	 In contrast, a small, controlled, prospective study had mothers monitor their infants for signs of adverse effects (furring of the tongue, feeding difficulties, changes in stool frequency and consistency, diaper rash, and skin rash). Weight change and the development of jaundice were also recorded. No statistical differences in these parameters were found between the infants of the control mothers and those of mothers taking the related antibiotics, ampicillin or ampicillin-clavulanate.[4] A prospective, controlled study asked mothers who called an information service about adverse reactions experienced by their breastfed infants. Of 40 infants exposed to amoxicillin in breastmilk, 2 developed diarrhea and 1 developed a rash.[5] A study compared the breastfed infants of mothers taking amoxicillin to those taking a macrolide antibiotic. Adverse reactions occurred in 8.3% of the infants exposed to amoxicillin which was similar to the rate in macrolide-exposed infants. Reactions included rash and somnolence.[6] A 2-month-old infant breastfed since birth. His mother had taken many medications during pregnancy, but she did not recall their identity. She developed mastitis and was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 1 gram orally every 12 hours and gentamicin 160 mg intramuscularly once daily. The infant was breastfed for 10 minutes starting 15 minutes after the first dose of both drugs. About 20 minutes later, the infant developed a generalized urticaria which disappeared after 30 minutes. A few hours later, the infant breastfed again and the urticaria reappeared after 15 minutes and disappeared after an hour. After switching to formula feeding and no further infant exposure to penicillins, the reaction did not reappear with follow-up to 16 months of age. The adverse reaction was probably caused by the antibiotics in breastmilk. The drug that caused the reaction cannot be determined, but it was most likely the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid.[7]"

Milk levels after 11 and 12 days of therapy (times not stated) at that dose were 13 and 14 mcg/L.[1] A woman took aripiprazole 15 mg daily by mouth during pregnancy and postpartum. At 3 days postpartum, aripiprazole was not detectable in colostrum because of an unknown substance that interfered with the assay. On day 27 postpartum, 3 additional milk samples were collected at 30 minutes before the dose (24 hours after the last dose), and 4 and 10 hours after the dose. The drug and its metabolite were undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) in all samples. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive less than 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[2] A woman was taking aripiprazole 18 mg daily. On day 6 postpartum, a breastmilk sample (time not reported) contained a concentration of aripiprazole of 38.7 mcg/L.[3] A woman took aripiprazole 10 mg daily by mouth beginning in week 9 of pregnancy and continuing postpartum. Mid-nursing milk samples were obtained at 8 and 10 weeks postpartum over a 24-hour period after the dose. Aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were measured in the milk. On the first sampling day, mean milk concentrations were 52.6 mcg/L of aripiprazole and 8.8 mcg/L for the metabolite. On the second day, mean milk concentrations were 53.6 and 6.3 mcg/L, respectively. The authors calculated that a 5 kg infant would receive a daily dose of 47 mcg daily and the weight-adjusted dosage would be 8.3% of the maternal dosage.[4] Infant Levels: A woman was taking aripiprazole 18 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. On day 6 her breastfed infant had a serum concentration of 7.6 mcg/L, although some portion of the concentration could have been residual from transplacental transmission because of the drug's on half-life.[3]"

However, cases of galactorrhea apparently caused by aripiprazole have been reported.[14][15][16] One woman began taking aripiprazole 10 mg daily at week 20 of pregnancy. She underwent a cesarean section delivery at term, but was unable to establish lactation. The authors suggested that more data are needed to determine if aripiprazole adversely affects lactation.[17] A woman took aripiprazole 10 mg daily by mouth beginning in week 9 of pregnancy and continuing postpartum. She exclusively breastfed her infant for 6 weeks, but then began supplementation because of insufficient milk production. Her serum prolactin was 35 to 40 mcg/L, which is lower than expected for a nursing mother. The authors speculated that the aripiprazole might have been the cause of her low serum prolactin and  diminished her milk supply.[4] A woman with bipolar disorder was taking lithium during pregnancy and postpartum. At 10 days postpartum, her infant's serum lithium level was 0.26 mmol/L, so lithium was discontinued. Quetiapine was begun, but discontinued because of maternal sedation. Aripiprazole 2.5 mg daily was begun and within 24 hours, the mother noted a marked decrease in milk supply. After 2 weeks of working with a lactation consultant, she continued to have lactation difficulties and she switched back to lithium. Within 48 hours, her milk supply improved markedly.[18] A retrospective study of outpatients receiving an average aripiprazole dose of 17.3 mg daily (n = 20) or another antipsychotic (n = 141) found that those receiving such high-dose aripiprazole had an 81% chance of having hypoprolactinemia. Patients not treated with aripiprazole had only a 2.9% chance of having hypoprolactinemia.[19]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Most experts consider breastfeeding during azathioprine to be acceptable.[1][2][3][4][5] Studies in women with inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus or transplantation taking doses of azathioprine up to 200 mg daily for immunosuppression have found either low or unmeasurable levels of the active metabolites in milk and infant serum. Some evidence indicates a lack of adverse effects on the health and development of infants exposed to azathioprine during breastfeeding up to 3.5 years of age, but long-term follow-up for effects such as carcinogenesis have not been performed. Mothers with decreased activity of the enzyme that detoxifies azathioprine metabolites may transmit higher levels of drug to their infants in breastmilk. Cases of mild, asymptomatic neutropenia have been reported, so it might be desirable to monitor exclusively breastfed infants with a complete blood count with differential, and liver function tests if azathioprine is used during lactation, although some authors feel that monitoring is unnecessary.[6] Avoiding breastfeeding for 4 to 6 hours after a dose should markedly decrease the dose received by the infant in breastmilk."
    drug_levels: "Azathioprine is rapidly metabolized to the active metabolite mercaptopurine which is further metabolized to active metabolites including 6-methylmercaptopurine, thioguanine, 6-thioguanine nucleosides (6-TGNs),  6-methylmercaptopurine, and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleosides (6-MMPNs). The enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible for metabolism of 6-TGNs. Deficiencies in this enzyme can lead to excessive toxicity. Maternal Levels: Mercaptopurine milk levels were measured in 2 patients receiving azathioprine following renal transplantation. In one mother who was 2 days postpartum, peak colostrum levels occurred 2 and 8 hours after a 75 mg oral dose and were 3.4 and 4.5 mcg/L, respectively. In the other mother who was 7 days postpartum, a peak mercaptopurine milk level of 18 mcg/L occurred 2 hours after a 25 mg oral dose.[7] The milk levels of these 2 mothers correspond to 0.05% and 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosages, respectively. Infant serum levels were not measured. 	 Four women receiving an immunomodulator to treat inflammatory bowel disease had metabolite levels measured in milk during the first 6 weeks postpartum. The abstract does not mention the specific drug and dose being taken, but the azathioprine metabolites 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) and 6-TGNs were measured. Although therapeutic levels were found in maternal serum, 6-MMP (  < 650 mcg/L) and 6-TGNs were undetectable (  < 123 mcg/L) in milk (time of collection not stated).[8]A case series described 2 mothers who took azathioprine 100 mg daily while breastfeeding. Each mother collected milk samples over a 24-hour period, 5 and 6 samples, respectively. Mercaptopurine was undetectable (  < 5 mcg/L) in all of the samples. The authors estimated that the maximum dose of mercaptopurine that a completely breastfed infant would receive would be 0.09% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage or 0.07% of the dose given to infants following cardiac transplantation.[9] Ten women who were taking azathioprine 75 to 150 mg daily at the time of delivery for systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 7), renal transplant (n = 2) or Crohn's disease (n = 1) donated milk samples on days 3 to 4, 7 to 10 and 28 postpartum. Milk was collected before the single daily dose and at each breastfeed for 12 to 18 hours for a total of 31 samples. Only one woman taking azathioprine 100 mg daily had mercaptopurine detected in her milk. On day 28 postpartum, milk mercaptopurine concentrations were 1.2 mcg/L at 3 hours and 7.6 mcg/L at 6 hours after the dose.[10] Eight lactating women who were 1.5 to 7 months postpartum were taking azathioprine in dosages ranging from 75 to 200 mg daily for inflammatory bowel disease. All of the women had wild type TPMT phenotypes. Peak mercaptopurine milk concentrations occurred within the first 4 hours after ingesting of the dose of azathioprine and ranged from 2 to 50 mcg/L. By 5 hours after the dose, the milk concentrations of mercaptopurine had dropped markedly in all patients. The authors estimated that the \"worst case\" infant intake of mercaptopurine would 0.0075 mg/kg daily which is less than 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[11] Infant Levels: Four infants were breastfed (3 exclusively, 1 rarely received formula) during maternal use of azathioprine orally in dosages of 1.2 to 2.1 mg/kg daily. All of the mothers and infants had the wild type TPMT *1/*1 genotype and all of the mothers had normal enzyme activity. At 3 to 3.5 months of age, all of the infants had undetectable blood levels of 6-TGNs and 6-MMPN.[12] The authors later updated this report to include 2 previously unreported mother-infant pairs. These infant also had undetectable blood levels of 6-TGNs and 6-MMPN. Seven infants were breastfed during maternal intake of azathioprine in single oral doses of 75 to 150 mg daily. None had detectable mercaptopurine or thioguanine in their blood obtained between days 1 and 28 postpartum.[10] Three infants whose mothers were taking azathioprine for inflammatory bowel disease (n = 2) or systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1) were breastfed during maternal use of azathioprine. Azathioprine doses were 100 mg (plus prednisolone), 150 mg (plus infliximab) and 175 mg daily. In 1 infant, thioguanine was low, but detectable in blood at 3 days of age and 6-MMPN was undetectable; at 3 weeks of age, neither metabolite was detectable. In another infant, neither metabolite was detectable at 3 weeks of age. Neither assay limits nor specific maternal doses were stated in the published abstract.[13] A woman began taking azathioprine 100 mg (1.4 mg/kg) daily for Crohn's disease while breastfeeding (extent not stated) her 3-month-old infant. After 8 days and 3 months of maternal therapy, 6-TGNs were measured, although breastfeeding had been tapered to zero by 3 months. On both occasions, 6-TGNs were not detectable in the blood of the infant. The assay limit was not stated.[14]"

All three infants had no abnormal blood counts, no increased frequency of infections and above average growth rates.[7][15] The IgA levels in one mother's breastmilk were measured and found to be normal.[7] One infant was breastfed for 6 days after birth by a mother who was taking azathioprine 75 mg daily in addition to cyclosporine. Nursing was interrupted for 4 days, then partial breastfeeding was reestablished. The infant showed no signs of renal or neurologic toxicity or hirsutism during long-term follow up.[16] Twelve infants were breastfed for up to 12 months during maternal use of azathioprine 50 to 100 mg daily (6 with concomitant cyclosporine) following kidney or kidney-pancreas transplantation. Kidney function was normal in all infants when measured after breastfeeding had ceased. The growth and psychomotor development of all infants was normal.[17] One infant was exclusively breastfed for 10.5 months during maternal use of azathioprine 100 mg daily, cyclosporine and prednisone. Partial breastfeeding continued for 2 years. The infant thrived with normal growth at 12 months. The mother also breastfed a second child while on the same drug regimen.[18] Four infants were breastfed (3 exclusively, 1 rarely received formula) during maternal use of azathioprine orally in dosages of 1.2 to 2.1 mg/kg daily. At 3 to 3.5 months of age, all infants were healthy and were within the 50th to 95th percentiles on growth charts.[12] The authors reported 2 additional infants who received azathioprine via breastmilk with no adverse reactions detected.[19] In another case series, 4 infants were breastfed (partially in 1 case, not stated in the others) during maternal use of azathioprine. Two mothers took 100 mg daily, 1 took 75 mg daily and 1 took 50 mg daily and partially breastfed her preterm infant. All were taking several other medications concurrently. One infant was followed up at 1 month, 2 at 2 months and 1 at 1 year of age. No adverse events were reported in any of the infants and all were growing and developing normally.[9] Six infants whose mothers were breastfeeding and taking azathioprine were monitored monthly for the duration of their breastfeeding with blood counts and for evidence of infection. One infant developed a low blood count and breastfeeding was discontinued; the other 5 infants continued to breastfeed apparently without harm. The dosages of azathioprine, concurrent medications and the extent of breastfeeding were not reported in the brief published abstract.[20] Ten infants, 3 preterm, were breastfed during maternal intake of azathioprine in single oral doses of 75 to 150 mg daily. No signs of immunosuppression were seen in the infants during the first 28 days postpartum. In 7 of the infants, white cell and neutrophil counts were performed between days 1 and 28 postpartum. One infant had a borderline low neutrophil count but a normal white cell count.[10] A survey of women with autoimmune hepatitis found that 8 infants of 4 women had been breastfed (extent not stated) during maternal azathioprine use in unspecified dosages. No adverse effects were reported by the mothers.[21] An infant was breastfed (extent not stated) from birth to the age of 3 months during maternal therapy with azathioprine 100 mg (1.4 mg/kg) daily. During the 6 months of follow-up, the infant thrived and had no infections.[14] A nonrandomized, prospective study in Austria followed the infants of 23 women with inflammatory bowel disease who were treated in one clinic. Mothers who received azathioprine (median dose 150 mg daily; range 100 to 250 mg daily) for treatment breastfed for a median of 6 months (range 1 to 18 months) and those who did not take azathioprine breastfed for a median of 8 months (range 3.5 to 23 months). Follow-up occurred at a median of 3.3 years in the azathioprine-exposed infants (n = 15) and 4.7 years in the unexposed infants (n = 15). No differences were found in mental or physical development between the two groups of infants. More infants who were unexposed to azathioprine had more than 2 colds annually and more conjunctivitis episodes than in the unexposed group. No difference was seen in the numbers of other infections between the groups.[22] In The Netherlands, 30 infants of mothers taking either azathioprine (n = 28) or mercaptopurine (n = 2) for inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy and postpartum were followed at 1 to 6 years of age using a 43-item quality of life questionnaire. Of this cohort, 9 infants were breastfed for a mean of 7 months (range 3 to 13 months) No statistically significant differences were found between breastfed and formula-fed infants in any of the 12 domains of the survey.[23] In France, 30 infants of 29 mothers who took azathioprine 50 to 175 mg daily during pregnancy and nursed for at least 1 month (range 1 to 17 months) were followed. Three infants had low white blood cell (WBC) counts at birth that normalized during breastfeeding (extent not stated). Of 20 infants who had later WBC counts, one had mild, asymptomatic neutropenia during 1.5 months of breastfeeding that persisted for 15 days following breastfeeding discontinuation. No other adverse effects were seen during a median of 9.5 months (range 1.5 to 30 months) of follow-up.[24] A prospective cohort study followed	pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease throughout pregnancy and for 12 months postpartum. Women were assigned to one of the following groups: unexposed (no thiopurines or anti-TNF agents); group A (azathioprine or mercaptopurine); group B (infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab) and group AB (both a thiopurine and an anti-TNF agent). Of 1052 women enrolled in the study, 72% breastfed their infants, although the extent and duration were not stated in the abstract. A total of 264 women were exposed to a thiopurine and 59 were exposed to a thiopurine plus an anti-TNF agent. The use of a thiopurine alone was not associated with any complication in the infants and their growth and development were normal throughout the 12 months. Infants exposed to both a thiopurine and an anti-TNF agent had a 50% increase in the number of infections between 9 and 12 months of age. The relationship of this increase with breastfeeding could not be determined from the available data.[25] As of December 2013, The National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry has collected information on a total of 83 mothers who had breastfed 117 infants for as long as 42 months with no apparent adverse effects in infants.[5]"

It was not detectable (assay limit not specified) in 3 of the women's milk.[3] The above studies used old insensitive and nonspecific assays. A more recent paper reported chlorpromazine milk levels of 7 to 98 mcg/L in 4 women whose serum levels ranged from 16 to 52 mcg/L (dosage not stated). Metabolites were also detectable, but not quantified. No clear, consistent relationship was found between serum and milk levels.[4] Chlorpromazine was measured in the milk of 4 women on long-term oral chlorpromazine therapy.

HPLC assay found that foremilk chlorpromazine levels ranged from   < 1 to 271 mcg/L, with no correlation to the maternal doses of 50 to 600 mg daily. Three hindmilk concentrations ranged from 4.2 to 18.9 mcg/L. Measurement of the same samples with an enzyme immunoassay found higher levels, ranging from undetectable 6 to 568 mcg/L. The authors considered these higher values to represent the contribution of undetermined metabolites that were unmeasured by HPLC.[7] Infant Levels: Two patients who were taking chlorpromazine in doses of 50 and 400 mg daily breastfed their infants (extent not stated). Two samples of urine were provided by each infant on separate occasions.

Neither maternal dosages nor serum levels were stated; however, the breastmilk chlorpromazine concentration was 92 mcg/L in the mother of the affected infant and 7 mcg/L in the mother of the unaffected infant.[4] A 5-month-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking chlorpromazine and dichloralphenazone, a chloral hydrate prodrug, became drowsy. Drowsiness was possibly related to chlorpromazine, but dichloralphenazone probably contributed.[9]Seven infants were breastfed for 3 to 4 months during maternal chlorpromazine therapy 50 to 150 mg/day at bedtime. They were followed clinically for periods of 5 to 16 months, blood counts and liver function tests were normal and the infants were healthy with normal development and behavior.[10] Five of the infants were later followed up at ages up to 4 to 5 years. No discernible problems in behavior, or emotion or mental disturbances were noted.[11] Six infants whose mothers were taking chlorpromazine had no discernible adverse effects from chlorpromazine in breastmilk.

It is particularly important to ensure that the infant's skin does not come into direct contact with the areas of skin that have been treated. Only the lower potency corticosteroids  should be used on the nipple or areola where the infant could directly ingest the drugs from the skin; clobetasol should be avoided on the nipple.[1] Only water-miscible cream or gel products should be applied to the breast because ointments may expose the infant to high levels of mineral paraffins via licking.[2] Any topical corticosteroid should be wiped off thoroughly prior to nursing if it is being applied to the breast or nipple area."

With typical maternal cyclosporine blood levels, a completely breastfed infant would usually receive no more than about 2% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage or pediatric transplantation maintenance dosage, and often less than 1%. Most infants studied have not had detectable cyclosporine blood levels, but 2 infants have had measurable levels, 1 with blood levels in the therapeutic range despite relatively low maternal milk levels.<br><br>  Numerous infants have been breastfed during maternal cyclosporine use, usually with a concurrent corticosteroid and sometimes with concurrent azathioprine. At least 2 mothers successfully breastfed a second infant after successfully breastfeeding the first infant. No reports of adverse effects on infants growth, development or kidney function have been reported, although thorough follow-up examinations have not always been performed or reported. Some reviewers believe breastfeeding should be discouraged during cyclosporine use, but these opinions appear to be based on limited, early data.[1][2] European experts, the National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry and other US experts consider cyclosporine to be probably safe to use for inflammatory bowel disease during breastfeeding.[3][4][5] Breastfed infants should be monitored if this drug is used during lactation, possibly including measurement of serum levels to rule out toxicity if there is a concern.<br><br>  Because absorption from the eye is limited, ophthalmic cyclosporine would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. To substantially diminish the amount of drug that reaches the breastmilk after using eye drops, place pressure over the tear duct by the corner of the eye for 1 minute or more, then remove the excess solution with an absorbent tissue."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Early reports measured cyclosporine in breastmilk unsystematically. Cyclosporine levels of 101, 109 and 263 mcg/L were detected in random samples of breastmilk on days 2, 3 and 4 postpartum from a woman taking 450 mg daily orally.[6] In one woman, a single milk concentration of 16 mcg/L was measured 22 hours after an oral dose of 325 mg given 2 hours before the onset of labor.[7] One mother's cyclosporine milk concentration averaged about 17% (range 12 to 22%) of simultaneous serum levels.[8] In another mother, milk cyclosporine levels ranged from 15 to 90% higher than simultaneous serum levels. However, the authors estimated that a breastfed infant would receive less than 5% of an immunosuppressive dose.[9] One breastfed infant was estimated to have a daily cyclosporine intake of 6 mcg/kg daily during maternal use of 225 mg daily of cyclosporine.[10] A case series of 3 mothers found the following cyclosporine levels in colostrum. The first mother was receiving 200 mg every 12 hours and had a colostrum level of 418 mcg/L 12 hours her last predelivery dose. The second mother was taking 150 mg every 12 hours and had a mean of 99 mcg/L (range 36 to 209 mcg/L) in 5 colostrum samples taken 3 to 5 days after delivery; The third mother was taking a dose of 125 mg every 12 hours and had levels of 45 to 83 mcg/L in 7 colostrum samples taken during the first 4 days postpartum; milk levels were 105 to 203 mcg/L in samples taken during days 6 to 10 postpartum.[11] A mother taking 3 mg/kg twice daily with a blood trough cyclosporine blood level of 260 mcg/L had average milk levels of 596 mcg/L 5 weeks postpartum with milk levels varying with the time after the dose. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive less than 0.1 mg/kg daily or less than 1.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[12] Five mothers taking cyclosporine in unspecified dosages had random milk levels ranging from 50 to 227 mcg/L in the immediate postpartum period. Two of these women collected several milk samples over the course of a day. A mother with a trough cyclosporine blood level of 62 mcg/L had milk levels ranging from 25 to 120 mcg/L. The other mother with a trough blood level of 110 mcg/L had milk levels ranging from 87 to 440 mcg/L. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive less than 300 mcg of cyclosporine daily.[13] One mother taking cyclosporine 300 mg twice daily had serum levels of 123 to 273 mcg/L and milk levels ranging from 79 to 286 mcg/L on 3 occasions over a 10-week period.[14]Variable milk levels of cyclosporine were noted in a case series of 5 mother-infant pairs. Individual average milk cyclosporine levels varied from 98 to 118 mcg/L (range 45 to 203 mcg/L) in 3 of the mothers. A fourth mother taking a dose of 5.3 mg/kg daily of Neoral had mean foremilk levels of 465 mcg/L and hindmilk levels of 564 mcg/L (minimum foremilk 158 mcg/L, maximum hindmilk 1016 mcg/L). Estimated intake for the 5 infants averaged 0.86% (range from 0.2 to 2.1%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. In 3 of the infants, average intake was 0.05 mcg/kg daily or about 1% of the pediatric maintenance dosage.[15] A woman was taking oral cyclosporine 100 mg in the morning and 75 mg in the evening (2.1 mg/kg daily) during pregnancy and lactation. She was also taking azathioprine 75 mg and prednisone 10 mg daily. A milk sample was obtained 2 hours after the mother's morning dose. The breastmilk cyclosporine concentration was 46 mcg/L.[16] A woman was taking cyclosporine for severe psoriasis during late pregnancy and while nursing. While taking a dose of 200 mg daily (apparently 100 mg twice daily), she collected milk samples 2 hours after her morning dose on 3 occasions. Milk cyclosporine levels were 128 mcg/L on day 10, 200 mcg/L on day 30, and 364 mcg/L on day 50. On day 40, the milk cyclosporine concentration before her morning dose was 207 mcg/L.[17] Infant Levels: In 7 mothers who breastfed their infants during cyclosporine use (dosages not stated), infant serum cyclosporine levels were undetectable (  < 30 mcg/L).[13] Another exclusively breastfed infant reportedly had undetectable serum cyclosporine levels (  < 25 mcg/L) with a maternal dose of 300 mg twice daily of the microemulsion.[14] A partially breastfed infant whose mother was taking 125 mg twice daily had cyclosporine blood levels of 18 to 21 mcg/L during the first 21 days of life.[11] Another mother taking cyclosporine 3 mg/kg twice daily exclusively breastfed her daughter who had undetectable (  < 3 mcg/L) cyclosporine blood levels.[10] Among 4 infants in whom blood levels were measured, 3 had undetectable levels, but the fourth had \"therapeutic\" blood levels of 117 and 131 mcg/L on 2 occasions even though the infant's estimated dosage was only 1.1% of maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[15] A 6-day-old infant who was about 50% breastfed had an undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) cyclosporine whole blood concentration. The infant's mother was taking oral cyclosporine 100 mg in the morning and 75 mg in the evening  (2.1 mg/kg daily) during pregnancy and lactation. The authors estimated that the cyclosporine dose this infant would receive if it were fully breastfed was 0.007 mg/kg or 0.33% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose.[16] Two cases were reported of infants whose mothers were taking cyclosporine and breastfeeding. One mother was taking cyclosporine 200 mg daily as well as azathioprine, prednisone, diltiazem and folate. She exclusively breastfed her infant and at 1 week postpartum the infant's serum had undetectable (  < 15 mcg/L) cyclosporine levels while the mother's serum contained 68 mcg/L. The second mother was taking cyclosporine 120 mg daily as well as methyldopa, prednisone, and calcitriol. She exclusively breastfed her infant and at 2 weeks postpartum the infant's serum had undetectable (  < 15 mcg/L) cyclosporine levels while the mother's serum contained 39 mcg/L.[18] A woman with severe ulcerative colitis during pregnancy received cyclosporine 5 mg/kg daily from 26 weeks of pregnancy and continued while breastfeeding. She extensive breastfed her infant and the infant's serum cyclosporine concentrations after the morning feed were consistently undetectable (  < 30 mcg/L).[19] An infant whose mother took cyclosporine 200 mg daily for severe psoriasis during late pregnancy and while nursing. The infant was exclusively breastfed for 6 months. The infant's cyclosporine blood levels were 30 mcg/L on day 10 at 2 hours after the maternal dose, and undetectable (  < 25 mcg/L) on days 30, 40 and 50. The authors hypothesized that the level reported on day 10 derived from cyclosporine in the infant's adipose tissue, received during pregnancy.[17] In summary, reported milk cyclosporine levels vary considerably in several case reports and series. This variability seems to be partially due to inconsistent sampling times among the reports and probably related to the fat content of the milk at the time of sampling. In one patient, cyclosporine levels averaged 21% higher in the high-fat hindmilk than in the low-fat foremilk.[15] In another patient, milk levels increased from the first few days of colostrum to the later mature milk phase. Estimations of the total amounts of drug in milk received by the infant are less than 5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, and as low as 0.01% in some infants. This translates to less than 2% of the pediatric transplantation maintenance dosage of cyclosporine in most infants. In most breastfed infants, cyclosporine is not detectable in blood; however, occasionally infants have had detectable blood levels, even when milk levels and infant dosage were apparently low.[7][11][15]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "One infant was breastfed and follow-up showed that the infant remained healthy and normal.[10] A mother who was taking cyclosporine 3 mg/kg twice daily completely breastfed her infant until weaning with partial breastfeeding until 14 months. The infant's kidney function was stable and she was healthy at 2 years of age. This mother also breastfed a second infant.[12] In 7 infants breastfed for 4 to 12 months during maternal cyclosporine and prednisolone (plus azathioprine in 6 of the 7), infant renal function was unaffected, and they grew normally.[13] One mother partially breastfed her infant during cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisone use. No follow-up data were reported.[11] One infant was exclusively breastfed for 10.5 months during maternal use of cyclosporine 300 mg twice daily, azathioprine and prednisone. Partial breastfeeding continued for 2 years. The infant thrived with normal growth at 12 months. The mother also breastfed a second child while on the same drug regimen.[14] Four infants breastfed during maternal cyclosporine use. In three, no adverse effects were noted clinically on follow-up and one of these had normal serum creatinine and urea nitrogen (BUN) measured. No follow-up was reported on the fourth infant.[15] Two cases were reported of infants whose mothers were taking cyclosporine and breastfeeding. One mother was taking cyclosporine 200 mg daily as well as azathioprine, prednisone, diltiazem, and folate. The second mother was taking cyclosporine 120 mg daily as well as methyldopa,  prednisone, and calcitriol. Both mothers exclusively breastfed their infants initially and continued for 5 and 14 months, respectively. The infants were reportedly healthy and had normal renal function.[18] A woman with severe ulcerative colitis during pregnancy received cyclosporine 5 mg/kg daily from 26 weeks of pregnancy and continued while breastfeeding. She extensive breastfed her infant and at 3 months of age the infant was healthy.[19] The National Transplantation Pregnancy Registry reported data gathered from 1991 to 2011 on mothers who breastfed their infants following organ transplantation. A total of 43 mothers with transplants (mostly kidney) used cyclosporine while breastfeeding a total of 49 infants. Duration of nursing ranged from 1 week to 2 years and follow-up of the children ranged from weeks to 16 years. One infant experienced mildly elevated platelet count and an abnormal albumin/globulin ratio for age; at 16 months, laboratory values were normal. There were no reports of problems in the remainder of the infants or children.[4] As of December 2013, a total of 43 mothers had breastfed 55 infants for as long as 24 months with no apparent adverse effects in infants.[5] A woman took cyclosporine 200 mg daily for psoriasis while exclusively breastfeeding her infant for 6 months. At 12 months of age, the infant was developing normally and had no discernible adverse effects from the drug in milk.[17]"

It is possible that these effects would interfere with initiation of lactation, but the prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

Short-term use of demeclocycline is acceptable in nursing mothers. As a theoretical precaution, avoid prolonged or repeat courses during nursing.

Milk volume was not affected if the infant was delivered less than 3 days or more than 10 days after the mother received the corticosteroid.[5] An equivalent dosage regimen of dexamethasone might have the same effect. A study of 87 pregnant women found that betamethasone given as above during pregnancy caused a premature stimulation of lactose secretion during pregnancy.

Women who have not received acellular pertussis vaccine with tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids (Tdap) previously should be vaccinated with Tdap as soon as feasible in the postpartum period, even if they are breastfeeding, as long as they have not been vaccinated with tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine within the past 2 years.[4] After vaccination, anti-pertussis antibodies appear in breastmilk within 1 to 2 weeks. Breastfeeding also appears to reduce infant side effects associated with routine childhood immunization. Breastfed infants should be vaccinated according to the routine recommended schedules."

Colostrum or breast milk and blood samples were collected at baseline and 7, 10, 14, and 28 days after vaccination. Breastmilk IgA levels against pertussis toxoid peaked at day 10 postpartum, then slowly decreased. Breast milk antibody levels against the other antipertussis vaccine components, filamentous hemagglutinin and fimbriae types 2 and 3, reached a plateau during days 10 to 14 and then slowly decreased. Breast milk antibody levels against another antipertussis vaccine component, pertactin, peaked on day 14 and then decreased by day 28.[5] The milk of 25 pregnant women given Tdap vaccine (Boostrix, GlaxoSmithKline) after 20 weeks of pregnancy was compared to colostrum from 12 unvaccinated women. Milk samples were collected prior to discharge after delivery (colostrum) and at 2, 4 and 8 weeks postpartum. Vaccinated women had significantly higher antipertussis antibody levels in their breastmilk than unvaccinated women. The primary class of imunoglobulins was IgA, which were highest in colostrum, but still detectable at 8 weeks.[6] Total and anti-pertussis toxin secretory IgA (sIgA) levels were measured in breastmilk from women who had been vaccinated either during pregnancy (n = 19), at or shortly after delivery (n = 34), less than 5 years before delivery (n = 9), or more than 5 years before delivery (n = 12). Tdap vaccine (Boostrix, GlaxoSmithKline) was used in the first 3 groups. Breastmilk samples were obtained between 44 and 91 days postpartum. No difference in total sIgA was found between the groups, but women who were vaccinated during pregnancy or shortly after birth had higher anti-pertussis toxin levels of sIgA than those vaccinated more than 5 years before. Higher anti-pertussis toxin sIgA levels were found among women practicing mixed feeding than among exclusively breastfeeding mothers.[7] Infant Levels:  Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

The angiotensin converting enzyme activity in milk of all women was within the normal range and unchanged after the dose compared to the predose values.[1] A woman who had been taking oral enalapril 10 mg daily for 11 months had peak enalapril milk levels of 2 mcg/L 4 hours after a dose and peak enalaprilat levels of 0.75 mcg/L about 9 hours after the dose.[2] Enalapril and enalaprilat milk levels were determined in 5 women who were in the immediate postpartum period and not breastfeeding. After a single 20 mg oral dose, the average peak enalapril milk level was 1.7 mcg/L (range 0.54 to 5.9 mcg/L) at 4 to 6 hours after the dose. Enalapril was not detectable (assay limit not specified) after 4 hours in 4 of the 5 women. The average peak enalaprilat level was 1.7 mcg/L (range 1.2 to 2.3 mcg/L); peaks occurred at various times over the 24-hour period.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: The milk of one mother contained 22 mcg/L after a total dose of gold sodium thiomalate of 370 over a 7-week period and 40 mcg/L after 395 mg over about 8 weeks.[6] Gold levels reached a peak of 30 mcg/L 17 hours after a 20 mg intramuscular dose of gold sodium thiomalate and persisted at about the same levels for at least 72 hours when another dose of 50 mg was administered. A peak milk level of 153 mcg/L was measured 22 hours after this dose and fluctuated around this level until at least 42 hours after the dose. In another mother reported in the same paper, peak milk level of 15 mcg/L occurred 36 hours after a dose of 10 mg. Following a subsequent dose of 20 mg, a peak milk level of 140 mcg/L occurred at 24 hours and 165 mcg/L at 69 hours after the dose. A third 20 mg dose resulted in a level of 185 mcg/L 3 hours after the dose when collection was stopped.[7]A woman received gold sodium thiomalate during pregnancy and after delivery in dose of 10 mg every 3 to 4 weeks. Milk levels ranged between 15 and 30 mcg/L after the postpartum doses.[8] Infant Levels: Gold was detectable in an infant's urine at a level of 0.4 mcg/L after a cumulative maternal dose of 370 mg over a 7-week period. One month later, gold was undetectable (  < 0.4 mcg/L) in the infant's urine after another maternal dose of 20 mg during this time.[6]A woman received gold sodium thiomalate during pregnancy and after delivery in dose of 10 mg every 3 to 4 weeks.

It is particularly important to ensure that the infant's skin does not come into direct contact with the areas of skin that have been treated. Only the lower potency corticosteroids  should be used on the nipple or areola where the infant could directly ingest the drugs from the skin; avoid halobetasol on the nipple.[1] Only water-miscible cream or gel products should be applied to the breast because ointments may expose the infant to high levels of mineral paraffins via licking.[2] Any topical corticosteroid should be wiped off thoroughly prior to nursing if it is being applied to the breast or nipple area."

Very limited long-term follow-up data indicate no adverse developmental effects when haloperidol is used alone. However, use with chlorpromazine occasionally might negatively affect development. Monitor the infant for developmental milestones, especially if other antipsychotics are used concurrently."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: In one woman, a milk level of 5 mcg/L was detected 11 hours after a dose during therapy with an average dose of 29.2 mg daily. Another level of 2 mcg/L was measured 9 hours after a 12 mg oral dose. Haloperidol was not detectable in milk 3 days after the last 7 mg dose.[1] During a regimen of haloperidol 5 mg orally twice daily in one woman, random milk levels were 18 and 23.5 mcg/L. On day 21 of therapy, the mother's milk level was 4 mcg/L.[2] A woman had been taking haloperidol for 29 days before and after delivery. Although she was not breastfeeding, a breastmilk sample was obtained 12 days postpartum when the dose had been 6 mg orally for 7 days. The milk haloperidol level 3 hours after the last dose was 1.7 mcg/L.[3] Three patients taking haloperidol 3, 4 and 6 mg daily had random milk levels of 32, 17 and 4.7 mcg/L at unspecified times after a dose, although the latter patient was reportedly nonadherent to the drug regimen.[4][5] Nine patients who were taking haloperidol had foremilk and/or hindmilk samples collected on 1 to 3 occasions 12 to 15 hours after the previous dose of haloperidol. HPLC assay found that foremilk haloperidol levels ranged from undetectable (  < 1 mcg/L) to 24.9 mcg/L, with no correlation to the maternal doses of 1 to 40 mg daily. Foremilk haloperidol concentrations correlated better with maternal plasma levels. Hindmilk concentrations were slightly higher than foremilk concentrations when both samples were collected. Measurement of the same samples with an enzyme immunoassay found higher levels, ranging from undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) to 988 mcg/L, again correlated better with maternal serum concentrations than maternal dosage. The authors considered the higher values to represent the contribution of undetermined metabolites that were unmeasured by HPLC.[6] Infant Levels:  A nursing mother took haloperidol 5 mg orally twice daily. On day 21 of therapy, the infant's urine contained 1.5 mcg/L of haloperidol.[2] Four breastfed infants whose mothers were taking haloperidol is doses of 5 to 20 mg daily had serum concentrations measured by enzyme immunoassay.

The infant showed normal development when tested once between 1 and 4 months and once between 12 and 18 months of age.[7] In a small prospective study on the long-term effects of antipsychotics in breastfed infants, a decline in developmental scores was found at 12 to 18 months of age in 2 of the 4 the infants of mothers taking both chlorpromazine and haloperidol. The other 2 infants and all infants exposed to either drug alone developed normally.[6] One woman with schizophrenia took haloperidol and trihexyphenidyl during 3 pregnancies and postpartum. Haloperidol doses were 7.5 to 10 mg daily in the first 2 pregnancies and 15 mg daily in the third. She breastfed (extent not stated) all 3 children for 6 to 8 months using the same doses.

In addition, milk contained an amount of acid-labile hydrazones with undefined pharmacologic activity. The authors estimated that a breastfed infant would receive a maximum of 13 mcg per feeding at this maternal dosage.[1] Ten lactating women had blood and breastmilk samples analyzed within 24 hour after receiving a dose of hydralazine of between 10 and 40 mg in the first week postpartum. The analytic method measured hydralazine plus its pharmacologically active acid-labile metabolites. The average concentration of drugs in breastmilk was 240 nmol/L, which was about half of the simultaneous concentration in maternal plasma. The authors estimated that the daily dose to a breastfed infant would likely not exceed 25 mcg.[2] Infant Levels: Two infants were breastfed after their mothers had received a dose of hydralazine between 10 and 40 mg during the first week postpartum., At 2 hours after feeding, infant serum drug concentration were 557 and 293 nmol/L. The analytic method measured hydralazine plus its pharmacologically active acid-labile metabolites. These values were much lower than those found in a 2 kg infant who was receiving hydralazine 6 mg/kg daily directly for coarctation of the aorta. Serum levels in this infant were 6230 nmol/L before a 4 mg dose, and 8050 and 8310 nmol/L at 2 and 4 hours after the dose, respectively. Two other infants who received sterilized (100 degrees C for 10 minutes) breastmilk from their mothers who were taking hydralazine had no detectable hydralazine in their serum 2 hours after receiving the breastmilk feeding.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Two early studies attempted measurement of ibuprofen in milk. In one, the patient's dose was 400 mg twice daily, while in the second study of 12 patients, the dose was 400 mg every 6 hours. Ibuprofen was undetectable in breastmilk in both studies (  < 0.5 and 1 mg/L, respectively).[1][2] A later study using a more sensitive assay found ibuprofen in the breastmilk of one woman who took 6 doses of 400 mg orally over a 42.5 hours. A milk ibuprofen level of 13 mcg/L was detected 30 minutes after the first dose. The highest level measured was 180 mcg/L about 4 hours after the third dose, 20.5 hours after the first dose. The authors estimated that the infant would receive about 17 mcg/kg daily (100 mcg daily) with the maternal dose of approximately 1.2 grams daily. This dose represents 0.0008% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage[3] and 0.06% of the commonly accepted infant dose of 30 mg/kg daily (10 mg/kg every 8 hours). Single milk samples were taken from 13 women between 1.5 and 8 hours after the third dose of ibuprofen in a daily dosage regimen averaging 1012 mg daily (range 400 to 1200 mg daily). Of the 13 milk samples analyzed, the mean milk concentration was 361 mcg/L (range 164 to 590 mcg/L). The mean weight-adjusted percentage of the maternal dosage (relative infant dosage [RID]) was estimated to be   < 0.38%; however, the RID varied with the time postpartum and the milk protein content. The RID was highest in the colostral phase when the milk protein content was the highest (RID 0.6%).

Assuming that undetectable milk levels had the concentration of the assay limit, the average dosage excreted in milk was 0.27% of maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[1] However, the excretion of the glucuronide metabolite into milk was not measured and it could be absorbed as indomethacin by a newborn. Eight women donated milk on days 4, 12 and 26 postpartum for an in vitro measurement of protein binding and lipid partitioning of indomethacin in milk. Results were used to estimate passage into milk using physicochemical principles. The authors calculated that a breastfed infant would receive about 0.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted  dosage or about 3% of the neonatal dose used to treat patent ductus arteriosus with a maternal dosage of 75 mg daily.[2] This study did not account for possible contribution to the infant's dosage by the glucuronide metabolite.

No metabolic findings could account for the convulsions and no indomethacin levels were measured in the mother or infant.[3] This case was rated as indomethacin possibly causing the seizure; however later studies and the established therapeutic use of indomethacin in newborns make this causality seem unlikely.In one study, 7 women breastfed their neonates while taking indomethacin.

On day 7 postpartum, insulin dosage returned to prepregnancy requirements.[6] Another study found that dosage requirements did not return to normal for up to 6 weeks in some mothers.[7] A third study found that at 4 months postpartum, patients with type 1 diabetes who exclusively breastfed had an average of 13% lower (range -52% to +40%) insulin requirement than their prepregnancy requirement.[8] Breastfeeding appears to improve glucose postpartum glucose tolerance in mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus[9][10] and in normal women.[11]<br><br>  A small, well-controlled study of women with type 1 diabetes mellitus using continuous subcutaneous insulin found that the average basal insulin requirement in women with type 1 diabetes who breastfed was 0.21 units/kg daily and the total insulin requirement was 0.56 units/kg daily. In similar women who did not breastfeed, the basal insulin requirement was 0.33 units/kg daily and the total insulin requirement was 0.75 units/kg daily. The 36% lower basal insulin requirement was thought to be caused by glucose use for milk production.[12]<br><br> Lactation onset occurs later in patients with type 1 diabetes than in women without diabetes, with a greater delay in mothers with poor glucose control.[6][13] Mothers with type 1 diabetes also discontinue nursing at a higher rate during the first week postpartum.[14][15][16] Once established, lactation persists as long in mothers with diabetes as in mothers without diabetes.[13][17] However, as in women without diabetes, smoking has a strong negative impact on lactation among mothers with type 1 diabetes.[8][18] Other factors that have been identified as causes of shorter duration of breastfeeding among type 1 diabetic patients are more frequent caesarean sections and earlier delivery.[19] Among patients with gestational diabetes, those treated with insulin have a delayed onset of lactogenesis II compared to those not treated with insulin.[20]"

Mothers of preterm infants had nonsignificant changes in milk insulin levels.[23]In a study of 7 diabetic nursing mothers and 10 nondiabetic nursing mothers, blood glucose was elevated to about 300 mg/dL using a continuous intravenous glucose infusion. Regular pork insulin  was then given intravenously to lower the blood glucose. Glucose and insulin were measured in the breastmilk of all the mothers. The milk glucose of women with diabetes approximately tripled during the experiment, but milk glucose remained low in the nondiabetic women. Milk insulin was elevated in the diabetic women, with the peak milk insulin level occurring between 30 to 50 minutes after the intravenous injection. Nine of the 10 nondiabetic women had detectable insulin levels in breastmilk which ranged from 5.1 to 13 milli-IU/mL.[24] nsulin was measured in donor milk from 34 nondiabetic women who were between 1 month and 1 year postpartum. The average insulin concentration was 163 picomoles/L. After pasteurization using the Holder method (62.5 degrees C for 30 min), the average concentration was 88 picomoles/L.[5]A small study measured breastmilk insulin concentrations in control mothers (n = 5; 1 to 6 months postpartum), mothers with type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 4; 2 to 5 months postpartum) and type 2 diabetes (n = 5; 5 to 6 months postpartum). No differences were found in the insulin content among the 3 groups and little circadian variation was found. Mothers with type 1 diabetes were well controlled on insulin aspart and insulin glargine. No endogenous insulin was found in their breastmilk, but the milk of 3 of the mothers contained an average 20.5 milliunits/L of insulin, presumed to be of exogenous origin. No indication of paracellular diffusion of insulin was apparent in these women and C-peptide levels in milk were only 5 to 7% those of control mothers. These findings indicate that insulin is likely actively transported into breastmilk.[25] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

Mothers were given prenatal information on breastfeeding and were offered postnatal counseling by a nurse on the benefits of breastfeeding. All infants were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at about 2 hours of age for the following 24 hours. When possible, mothers either breastfed or pumped milk for their infants during this time. Mothers were contacted at 5 days and 4 months postpartum to determine their breastfeeding status. The rates of initiation of exclusive and nonexclusive breastfeeding and exclusive formula feeding and the rates at 4 months postpartum were no different from those of the Danish population.[8] Eight hundred eighty-three patients with gestational diabetes were interviewed at 6 to 9 weeks postpartum. Those who had been treated with insulin more frequently reported having a delayed onset of lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) postpartum than those not treated with insulin.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Most sources consider breastfeeding to be contraindicated during maternal antineoplastic drug therapy, although antimetabolites such as mercaptopurine appear to pose the least risk to breastfed infants.[1] After high-dose chemotherapy, it might be possible to breastfeed safely during intermittent therapy with an appropriate period of breastfeeding abstinence. Although no data are available to determine an appropriate period to withhold breastfeeding, the drug's terminal half-life suggests that withholding breastfeeding for 1 to 2 days may be sufficient. Chemotherapy may adversely affect the normal microbiome and chemical makeup of breastmilk.[2]<br><br>  In the treatment of conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, low doses of mercaptopurine (6-MP) for immunosuppression appear to be acceptable.[3][4][5][6][7] No active metabolites of mercaptopurine were found in the blood of breastfed infants whose mothers were taking azathioprine and no adverse effects attributable to mercaptopurine or azathioprine have been noted. See the Azathioprine record for details. Mothers with decreased activity of the enzyme that detoxifies mercaptopurine metabolites may transmit higher levels of drug to their infants in breastmilk. It might be desirable to monitor exclusively breastfed infants with a complete blood count with differential, and liver function tests if mercaptopurine is used during lactation, although some authors feel that monitoring is unnecessary.[8]"
    drug_levels: "Mercaptopurine is the active metabolite of azathioprine. It is further metabolized to active metabolites including 6-methylmercaptopurine, thioguanine, 6-thioguanine nucleosides (6-TGNs) and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleosides (6-MMPN). The enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is responsible for metabolism of 6-TGNs. Deficiencies in this enzyme can lead to excessive toxicity. Maternal Levels: Mercaptopurine milk levels were measured in 2 patients receiving azathioprine following renal transplantation. In one, peak milk levels occurred 2 and 8 hours after a 75 mg oral dose and were 3.4 and 4.5 mcg/L respectively. In the other, a peak milk level of 18 mcg/L occurred 2 hours after a 25 mg oral dose. Serum levels were not measured.[9] Four women receiving an immunomodulator to treat inflammatory bowel disease had metabolite levels measured in milk during the first 6 weeks postpartum. The abstract does not mention the specific drug and dose being taken, but the azathioprine metabolites 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) and 6-thioguanine nucleosides (6-TGNs) were measured. Although therapeutic levels were found in maternal serum, 6-MMP (  < 650 mcg/L) and 6-TGNs were undetectable (  < 123 mcg/L) in milk (time of collection not stated).[10] Infant Levels: Four infants were breastfed (3 exclusively, 1 rarely received formula) during maternal use of azathioprine orally in dosages of 1.2 to 2.1 mg/kg daily. All of the mothers and infants had the wild type TPMT *1/*1 genotype and all of the mothers had normal enzyme activity. At 3 to 3.5 months of age, all of the infants' had undetectable blood levels of 6-TGNs and 6-MMPN.[11]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In The Netherlands, 30 infants of mothers taking either azathioprine (n = 28) or mercaptopurine (n = 2) for inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy and postpartum were followed at 1 to 6 years of age using a 43-item quality of life questionnaire. Of this cohort, 9 infants were breastfed for a mean of 7 months (range 3 to 13 months) No statistically significant differences were found between breastfed and formula-fed infants in any of the 12 domains of the survey.[12] A prospective cohort study followed	pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease throughout pregnancy and for 12 months postpartum. Women were assigned to one of the following groups: unexposed (no thiopurines or anti-TNF agents); group A (azathioprine or mercaptopurine); group B (infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab) and group AB (both a thiopurine and an anti-TNF agent). Of 1052 women enrolled in the study, 72% breastfed their infants, although the extent and duration were not stated in the abstract. A total of 264 women were exposed to a thiopurine and 59 were exposed to a thiopurine plus an anti-TNF agent. The use of a thiopurine alone was not associated with any complication in the infants and their growth and development were normal throughout the 12 months. Infants exposed to both a thiopurine and an anti-TNF agent had a 50% increase in the number of infections between 9 and 12 months of age. The relationship of this increase with breastfeeding could not be determined from the available data.[13]"

Milk metformin levels are relatively constant during maternal metformin use, so timing of breastfeeding with respect to the administration times is of little benefit. Although the dose in milk is low, metformin is sometimes detectable in low levels in the serum of breastfed infants. One sizeable prospective study found no adverse effects in breastfed infants. Metformin should be used with caution while nursing newborn and premature infants and those with renal impairment."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Seven women (time postpartum not stated) were taking metformin with a median dose of 1500 mg daily (14 mg/kg daily; range 6.9 to 20 mg/kg daily) orally. Six of the women were taking an immediate-release product 500 mg three times daily and one was taking 500 mg as a sustained-release product once daily. Six women had milk levels that varied little over 24 hours and averaged 270 mcg/L. One woman had a slight rise in the milk level to about 380 mcg/L at about 4 to 5 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 0.04 mg/kg daily (range 0.02 to 0.06 mg/kg daily) or 0.28% (range 0.16 to 0.4%) the maternal weight-adjusted dosage with this maternal dosage regimen.[1][2]Two lactating women who were 14 and 14.5 months postpartum took a single dose of 500 mg of immediate-release metformin. Milk levels were relatively constant over the next 72 hours with average levels of 130 and 270 mcg/L; a slight peak occurred in one mother 12 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that their infants received 0.11 and 0.25% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Three other mothers were studied in the same way for 12 or 24 hours and had results consistent with the 2 more completely studied mothers.[3]Three women who had been taking immediate-release metformin 500 mg twice daily orally for at least several days were studied. Relatively stable milk levels averaging 130 to 270 mcg/L in the 3 mothers was found. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 29 mcg/kg daily (range 20 to 41 mcg/kg daily) or 0.2% (range 0.18 to 0.21%) of their mother's weight-adjusted dosage with this dosage regimen.[3]Five women began metformin 500 mg twice daily on the first day postpartum. Trough and peak (2 hours after the dose) milk levels were collected 4 to 17 days postpartum. The average milk metformin levels were estimated to be 410 mcg/L. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 0.65% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[4]Four women who were taking metformin during pregnancy and lactation provided breastmilk samples at 2- to 3-hour intervals over one dosage interval using a breast pump and emptying both breasts at each sampling time. The total amount of metformin excreted into milk was 0.13 mg with 1.5 g daily (n = 1) and an average of 0.21 mg with 2 g daily (n = 3). These values corresponded to infant dosages ranging from 0.024 to-0.050 mg/kg/day and an average of 0.25% (range 0.14 to 0.43%) of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage.[5] Infant Levels: Serum levels were measured in 4 breastfed infants (ages and extent of nursing not stated) whose mothers were taking a median metformin dosage of 1.5 g daily. In 2, metformin was undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) 2.5 hours after the maternal dose, while in the other 2, levels of 50 and 80 mcg/L (10 and 15% of their mother's serum levels) were found at 6 and 5.3 hours after the maternal dose, respectively.[1][2]Three women 2, 5 and 14 months postpartum who had been taking immediate-release metformin 500 mg twice daily orally for at least several days were studied. Metformin was undetectable (  < 5 mcg/L) in the serum of the 2 infants (extent of nursing not stated) aged 2 and 14 months in whom it was measured.[2]"

Failures were attributed to poor milk production in 4 women, demands of multiple births, infant prematurity, cleft palate and mastitis.[8] In a follow-up to a placebo-controlled study on metformin use during pregnancy in women with  polycystic ovary syndrome, women were asked about the duration and extent of breastfeeding.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited information indicates that oral maternal doses of methylprednisolone up to 8 mg daily produce low levels in milk and would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. With high intravenous maternal doses, such as 1 gram for multiple sclerosis relapse, fully breastfed infants would receive doses nearing their daily cortisol output, but less than a therapeutic dose, on the day of infusion. Avoiding breastfeeding during the infusion and for 2 to 8 hours after a 1 gram dose is recommended by various sources.[1][2][3] Local injections, such as for tendinitis, would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants, but might occasionally cause temporary loss of milk supply."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: In one woman taking 6 mg daily of methylprednisolone by mouth, 2 peak milk levels occurred: one at 2 hours after the dose and another 8 hours after the dose. Peaks were about 7 mcg/L, while levels fell to about 2.5 mcg/L 6 hours after the dose and to about 1 mcg/L 10 hours after the dose.[4] A woman with multiple sclerosis had a relapse in the first 3 months postpartum. She was given methylprednisolone 1 gram daily for 3 days. Milk samples were obtained after one of the doses. The breastmilk methylprednisolone was 3 mg/L immediately after the dose and 1.2 mg/L at 4 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that an infant who nurses at 4 hours after a dose will ingest 0.168 mg of methylprednisolone which is equivalent of 0.84 mg of cortisol or 42% of the daily output. An infant who nurses starting at 8 hours after a dose will ingest 0.048 mg of methylprednisolone which is equivalent to 12% of daily cortisol production. The authors did not specify their method of calculating these values.[2] A woman with multiple sclerosis who was 5 months postpartum received 1 gram of methylprednisolone infused intravenously over 2 hours on 3 successive days. She provided milk samples at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after each dose. Breastmilk levels at 0 and 12 hours were not quantifiable (  < 0.06 mg/L). Peak levels occurred at 1 hour after the end of the infusion and averaged 5.3 mg/L (range 5.1 to 5.6 mg/L). By 4 hours, after the dose, milk levels averaged 1.1 mg/L (range 1.0 to 1.6 mg/L) and by 8 hours, milk levels averaged 0.27 mg/L (range 0.2 to 0.37 mg/L). The authors calculated that a fully breastfed infant would have received an average of 0.19 mg/kg daily (range 0.16 to 0.21 mg/kg daily) of methylprednisolone, which is less than the lowest recommended therapeutic dose for infants. Withholding nursing for 2 to 4 hours after a dose would reduce the dose substantially.[3] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "None reported with methylprednisolone or any other corticosteroid. None reported with methylprednisolone or any other corticosteroid. Three infants were breastfed from birth during maternal use of methylprednisolone 6 to 8 mg daily with no reported adverse effects up to 3 months.[4][5] In one of the papers, 2 infants had normal blood cell counts, no increase in infections and above average growth rates.[5]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A patient who was 6 weeks postpartum and predominantly breastfeeding her infant received 24 mg of depot methylprednisolone plus 15 mg of lidocaine intralesionally for tenosynovitis of the wrist. Thirty hours after the injection, lactation ceased. Her breasts were soft and not engorged at that time. Thirty-six hours later, lactation resumed slowly, reaching normal milk production 24 hours later. The author hypothesized that the suppression might have occurred because the injection was in a highly mobile joint, which might have caused rapid release of the corticosteroid.[6] A large dose of triamcinolone injected into the shoulder has also been reported to cause temporary cessation of lactation.[7] A study of 46 women who delivered an infant before 34 weeks of gestation found that a course of another corticosteroid (betamethasone, 2 intramuscular injections of 11.4 mg of betamethasone 24 hours apart) given between 3 and 9 days before delivery resulted in delayed lactogenesis II and lower average milk volumes during the 10 days after delivery. Milk volume was not affected if the infant was delivered less than 3 days or more than 10 days after the mother received the corticosteroid.[8] An equivalent dosage regimen of methylprednisolone might have the same effect. A study of 87 pregnant women found that betamethasone given as above during pregnancy caused a premature stimulation of lactose secretion during pregnancy. Although the increase was statistically significant, the clinical importance appears to be minimal.[9] An equivalent dosage regimen of methylprednisolone might have the same effect."

The mean dose was 7.5 mg daily (range 5 to 20 mg daily) and serum levels were at steady state. A median peak serum level of 16 mcg/L occurred 5.2 hours (range 0.7 to 13.2 hours) after the dose. The median infant dosage was 1.12% (range 0.22 to 1.19%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage in 6 of the mothers and 1.13% in the seventh.[3] A woman was taking olanzapine 5 mg orally 3 times daily, amounting to 270 mcg/kg daily. After 11 days on olanzapine, a milk sample was taken just before nursing (time after dose not reported). The concentration of olanzapine was 12 ng per gram of breastmilk. The authors estimated that was 0.3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[4]A woman was started on oral olanzapine 5 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening daily 3 months postpartum. Two weeks later, the milk concentration (time after dose not stated) was 5 mcg/L. Over a period of 5 months, milk olanzapine concentrations decreased somewhat with time and a reduction in dosage to a concentration of 3 mcg/L with a dosage of 10 mg daily.[5] One woman was taking olanzapine 15 mg daily at 11 pm. She avoided breastfeeding from 11 pm to 7 am each day. Breastmilk samples were colleted at 4 am, 8 am and 11 pm daily for 26 days. The average olanzapine concentrations in her breastmilk were 15.8 mcg/L, at 4 am, 15.1 mcg/L at 8 am, and 7.8 mcg/L at 11 pm. The authors estimated that her infant would receive a maximum of 0.78 mg/kg daily and a median dosage of 0.21 mg/kg daily, which would translate to 0.47% and 0.13% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage, respectively.[6] Three women were taking olanzapine while breastfeeding. Dosages and corresponding milk olanzapine levels were as follows: 0.18 mg/kg daily with a level of 30 mcg/L on day 11 postpartum; 0.26 mg/kg daily with a milk levels of 35 mcg/L on day 10 postpartum; and 0.26 mg/kg daily with 8 milk levels were taken at 2 weeks postpartum. Levels ranged from 11 mcg/L at 23 hours after a dose to 21 mcg/L at 9 hours after the following dose.[7]A woman with bipolar disorder who delivered twins and was taking sodium valproate was started on olanzapine 15 mg and quetiapine 200 mg at 11 pm daily after 20 days postpartum. She withheld breastfeeding during the night and discarded milk pumped at 7 am. She then breastfed her infants until 11 pm. After 7 days of therapy, milk samples were obtained at 4 am, 8 am and 11 pm for 27 of the next 45 days. The median average daily olanzapine milk concentration was 10.2 mcg/L. Median milk concentrations were 12.7 mcg/L at 4 am, 10 mg/L at 8 am and 7.6 mg/L at 11 pm. The authors calculated that if the infants had been fully breastfed, they would have received a daily dosage of 1.29 mcg/kg or 0.74% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. By withholding nursing during the night, the infants' quetiapine dosage was reduced by 36% compared to the dose they would have received if they had been breastfed around the clock.[8] Infant Levels. At birth, the infant of one mother who was taking olanzapine 10 mg daily orally had an olanzapine serum level of about one-third that of the mother. The infant was breastfed (extent not stated) and had undetectable serum levels (  < 2 mcg/L) at 2 and 6 weeks of age.[8] In one 4-month-old infant, olanzapine was undetectable (  < 1 mcg/L) in serum 15 hours after the mother's dose (dose unstated).[2] Olanzapine was undetectable (  < 0.1 to 0.5 mcg/L) in the serum of 5 breastfed infants with an average age 2.4 months (range 0.1 to 4.3 months) whose mothers were taking a mean dose of 7.5 mg daily (range 2.5 to 20 mg daily).[3]A 5-month-old infant was breastfed (extent not stated) by a mother who had been taking olanzapine 5 mg 3 times daily for 11 days. After an overnight fast, the infant's serum olanzapine concentration was   < 5 mcg/L.[4] The mother of a 3 month-old breastfed (extent not stated) infant was started on olanzapine 5 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening daily by mouth. Two weeks later, the infant's olanzapine serum concentration (time stated) was 11 mcg/L. At 5 and 6 months of age, the serum concentration was 0 and 0.8 mcg/L, respectively. At 7 months of age, the serum concentration was 1.3 mcg/L with a maternal dose of 10 mg daily. At 8 months of age, the serum concentration was 0.02 mcg/L with a maternal dose of 5 mg daily. At 9 months of age, the serum concentration was 0.8 mcg/L with a maternal dose of 10 mg daily. Whether the variability in infant concentrations was caused by variable sampling times or by changes in maternal dosage, infant metabolism, or extent of breastfeeding cannot be determined from the report.[5] In three case reports, mothers taking dosages of olanzapine of 0.17, 0.18 and 0.26 mg/kg daily breastfed their newborn infants (extent: one full, one partial and the other not clearly stated). All infants had undetectable (  < 5 mcg/L) olanzapine plasma levels after 4 days to 2 weeks of nursing.[7]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "The manufacturer compiled reports of adverse effects reported in breastfed infants whose mothers were taking olanzapine.[9] Reports were compiled from spontaneous reports from physicians and mothers, clinical trials and published papers. Details of the exposures were not provided. Some of the infants reported appear to be the same as those reported in references [2][3][4][5][9] below. Overall, 102 breastfed infants were identified whose mothers were taking olanzapine. Of these, 62 reported dosage taken during pregnancy that averaged 7.4 mg daily by mouth. The duration of exposure to olanzapine was reported in 30 nursing mothers with a median of 30 days and mean of 74 days. Of the infants exposed to olanzapine via breastmilk, 15.6% reportedly experienced adverse effects, primarily somnolence, irritability, tremor and insomnia.[9] It appears that at least some of the adverse effects may have been a result of prenatal exposure to olanzapine. One infant was breastfed for 2 months during maternal intake of olanzapine 10 mg daily. No abnormalities were found in growth and development during 11 months of follow-up.[8] Five infants aged 3 weeks to 6 months were breastfed during maternal olanzapine 2.5 to 10 mg daily. No adverse health or developmental effects were noted during the observation period of 5 days to 8 weeks.[2] One infant was breastfed from birth during maternal use of olanzapine 5 mg daily orally. The infant was healthy at 6 months of age.[10]Six breastfed infants with an average age 2.4 months (range 0.1 to 4.3 months) whose mothers were taking olanzapine 2.5 to 20 mg daily had no adverse effects reported by their mothers or found on detailed medical testing. Development was deemed normal in 4 infants after extensive testing. A fifth had a somewhat decreased intellectual development on testing, but her mother had also taken clonazepam, droperidol, sertraline, thioridazine and valproic acid while breastfeeding. Four of the infants' body weight were maintained, one fell slightly and one dropped from the 97th percentile at birth to the 50th percentile upon later measurement. One of the infants reportedly had drowsiness during maternal intake of 10 mg daily, but it was not evident 3 weeks after reducing the dose to 5 mg daily. The drowsiness was possibly related to olanzapine in milk.[3] A 5-month-old infant was breastfed (extent not stated) by a mother who took olanzapine 5 mg 3 times daily for 13 days, then 5 mg twice daily. The infant was followed up after 2 months. The infant gained weight steadily and no jaundice or motor function impairment were noted.[4]A case-control study compared mothers who took olanzapine 2.5 to 10 mg daily during breastfeeding to those who took the drug and did not breastfeed, and nursing mothers who took acetaminophen which is thought to be safe during breastfeeding. Mothers filled out a questionnaire regarding adverse infant outcomes at 1 to 2 years postpartum. The percentage of adverse outcomes in the breastfed infants who were exposed to olanzapine in breastmilk (n = 22) was greater (14%), than those in the nonbreastfed (n = 15; 7%) and breastfed infants without olanzapine exposure (n = 51; 8%), but these differences were not statistically significant. Long-term adverse outcomes seen included speech delay in 1 infant, motor development delay in 1 infant and failure to gain weight in 2 infants (one infant experienced 2 adverse outcomes).[11] A woman took 10 mg of olanzapine (0.18 mg/kg) daily during pregnancy and postpartum She began breastfeeding at 7 days postpartum and continued to breastfeed for an unstated period. At 12 weeks of age, a pediatric examination was normal. Another woman who took olanzapine throughout pregnancy was taking olanzapine 0.17 mg/kg daily while she partially breastfed her infant. The total duration of breastfeeding was not stated, but the infant had developed normally at 20 months of age.[7] A woman with bipolar disorder who delivered twins and was taking sodium valproate in a therapeutic dosage was started on olanzapine 15 mg and quetiapine 200 mg at 11 pm daily after 20 days postpartum. She withheld breastfeeding during the night and discarded milk pumped at 7 am. She then breastfed her infants until 11 pm. The mother continued feeding the infants on this schedule for 15 months. Monthly follow-up of the infants indicated normal growth and neither the pediatricians nor the parents noted any adverse effects in the infants.[8] A woman with bipolar disorder was treated with olanzapine 10 mg and haloperidol 5 mg daily at the end of pregnancy and during breastfeeding (extent not stated). Follow-up of the breastfed infant for 11 months found no adverse effects and normal development of the infant.[13]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Unlike the phenothiazines, olanzapine has a minimal effect on serum prolactin levels.[14][15][16][17][18] However, olanzapine-induced hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea have been reported rarely. One patient was also taking venlafaxine and interferon beta-1b which can increase serum prolactin; however, galactorrhea began only after olanzapine was started.[19] In 2 studies, some patients who were taking a conventional antipsychotic agent or risperidone had their medication changed to olanzapine. Previously elevated prolactin levels normalized and galactorrhea diminished or stopped.[18][20] The maternal prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

After the third dose, milk oxacillin levels ranged from 0.04 to 0.1 mg/L, with the peak occurring at 3 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that a breastfed infant would receive 0.3 mg daily of oxacillin in milk.[2] In 10 women with mastitis who received 1 gram of oxacillin orally 3 times daily for 5 to 6 days, the average milk concentrations ranged from 0.43 to 0.68 mg/L.[3] Repeated injections of oxacillin 1 gram intramuscularly every 6 hours for 6 to 9 days in 15 women with monolateral mastitis yielded oxacillin milk levels that reached a peak of 0.49 mg/L at 3 hours after the first dose on the first day in the healthy breast, and somewhat lower levels in the breast with mastitis. After the last dose, peak milk levels of 0.64 mg/L occurred 6 hours after the dose in the unaffected breast with slightly lower levels in the breast with mastitis.[4] After a single intramuscular dose of 500 mg of oxacillin in 2 women, milk levels ranged from 0.18 to 0.7 mg/L between 1 and 4 hours, with the peak occurring at 2 to 4 hours after the dose. Only a trace was detectable at 6 hours after the dose.[5] In 15 women given a single 1 gram dose of oxacillin intravenously, milk levels averaged 0.68 mg/L at 2 hours after the dose.[6] Infant Levels. Ten women with mastitis received 1 gram of oxacillin orally 3 times daily for 5 to 6 days. Oxacillin was detectable in the urine in 5  of 6 of the breastfed infants in whom it was measured.

However, a close examination of available literature indicates that there is not likely to be harm in short-term use of oxytetracycline during lactation because milk levels are low and absorption by the infant is inhibited by the calcium in breastmilk. Short-term use of oxytetracycline is acceptable in nursing mothers. As a theoretical precaution, avoid prolonged or repeat courses during nursing.

The drug or breastfeeding should be discontinued if liver toxicity is suspected.<br><br>  Little PTU passes into breastmilk and infant thyroid suppression does not occur with usual maternal dosages. The American Thyroid Association[5] and others[6] state that it is safe for nursing mothers to use propylthiouracil in dosages up to 300 mg daily in divided doses.

Monitoring of the infant's complete blood count and differential is advisable if there is a suspicion of a drug-induced blood dyscrasia. Some authors have recommended routine monitoring of the breastfed infant's thyroxine (T4) and thyrotropin (TSH) during maternal propylthiouracil use.[5][6][7] However, no case of thyroid function alteration has been reported among infants exposed to PTU via breastmilk and other sources state than routine monitoring of thyroid function is unnecessary.[8]"

An infant whose mother was taking propylthiouracil 200 to 300 mg daily was followed for 5 months and found to have normal thyroid function tests.[10] A mother took PTU in a starting dose of 100 mg 3 times daily that was tapered to 50 mg twice daily over a period of 6 months. Her breastfed infant had normal thyroid function tests during this period at the ages of 9 to 13 months of age.[12] Eight mothers taking PTU during pregnancy and doses of 50 to 300 mg daily after delivery exclusively or nearly exclusively breastfed their infants. The infants all had slightly low free T4 levels at birth and TSH levels were above normal in 7 of the 8, indicating that they had been affected by PTU in utero. All of their infants had normal free T4 and TSH levels when measured between 18 days and 8 months of age and none had any adverse effects reported from PTU in milk.[13] The mothers of 11 fully breastfed infants were taking 300 to 750 mg daily of PTU starting at various times between delivery and 11 months postpartum.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: One mother took oral quetiapine 200 mg daily throughout pregnancy and postpartum. At 3 weeks postpartum, milk samples were taken. The average milk level over the 6-hour dosage interval was 13 mcg/L. A peak milk quetiapine level of 62 mcg/L occurred at 1 hour after the dose. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.09% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage on average, with a \"worst-case\" dosage (assuming all nursing was at the peak concentration) of 0.43% of weight-adjusted maternal dosage.[1] Six nursing mothers who were 6.5 to 18.5 weeks postpartum were taking quetiapine in doses of 25 to 400 mg daily in addition to an antidepressant for major depression postpartum. Milk samples obtained at various times after the dose had undetectable (  < 11.5 mcg/L) levels of quetiapine in the 4 mothers taking 75 mg daily or less. A mother taking 100 mg daily had a milk quetiapine level of 12.3 mcg/L and another taking 400 mg daily had a level of 101 mcg/L. The authors estimated that exclusively breastfed infants would receive less than 0.01 mg/kg daily with maternal doses of 100 mg daily or less and less than 0.1 mg/kg daily with a maternal dose of 400 mg daily.[2] A woman who was 3 months postpartum and taking quetiapine 400 mg daily, fluoxetine 40 mg daily, and oxycodone 20 mg 3 times daily had 16 milk samples taken over 24 hours starting immediately before a daily dose of quetiapine; 12 were paired fore- and hindmilk and the other 4 samples were mixtures of fore- and hindmilk. The highest quetiapine level measured in milk of about 170 mcg/L occurred within 1 hour after the dose. Milk levels dropped to nearly zero by 12 hours after the dose. No differences were noted between fore- and hindmilk concentrations. The authors estimated that the infant received 6.2 mcg/kg daily and that a fully breastfed infant would receive 0.09% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[3] A nursing mother was taking quetiapine in a dosage of 200 mg daily. Quetiapine was undetectable (  < 5 mcg/L) in her breastmilk.[4] In a study of 9 women taking quetiapine in an average dose of 37 mg daily (range 6.25 - 100 mg daily), simulations of infant exposure indicated that the infant would receive   < 0.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[5] Further analysis of the data was performed using NONMEM. Using the data obtained, 1000 computer simulations of breastmilk concentrations and infant dosages were performed. Results showed that 99% of breastfed infants would ingest quetiapine in dosages below 0.42% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose.[6] One woman was taking quetiapine 200 mg daily at 11 pm. She avoided breastfeeding from 11 pm to 7 am each day. Breastmilk samples were colleted at 4 am, 8 am and 11 pm daily for 26 days. The average quetiapine concentrations in her breastmilk were 11.7 mcg/L, at 4 am, 5.4 mcg/L at 8 am, and 0.9 mcg/L at 11 pm. The authors estimated that her infant would receive a maximum of 0.37 mg/kg daily and a median dosage of 0.1 mg/kg daily, which would translate to 0.017% and 0.005% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage, respectively.[7] A woman with bipolar disorder who delivered twins and was taking sodium valproate was started on quetiapine 200 mg and olanzapine 15 mg at 11 pm daily after 20 days postpartum. She withheld breastfeeding during the night and discarded milk pumped at 7 am. She then breastfed her infants until 11 pm. After 7 days of therapy, milk samples were obtained at 4 am, 8 am and 11 pm for 27 of the next 45 days. The median average daily quetiapine milk concentration was 3.7 mcg/L. Median milk concentrations were 10.7 mcg/L at 4 am, 3.7 mg/L at 8 am and 0.9 mg/L at 11 pm. The authors calculated that if the infants had been fully breastfed, they would have received a daily dosage of 0.38 mcg/kg or 0.02% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. By withholding nursing during the night, the infants' quetiapine dosage was reduced by 55% compared to the dose they would have received if they had been breastfed around the clock.[8] Infant Levels. A 3-month-old infant who was breastfed 6 to 7 times daily during maternal use of 400 mg daily of quetiapine had a plasma quetiapine level of 1.4 mcg/L. This level was 6% of the mother's quetiapine plasma level at the same time.[3] In a study of 9 women taking quetiapine in an average dose of 37 mg daily (range 6.25 - 100 mg daily), simulations of infant exposure indicated that the infant would be expected to attain serum concentrations   < 0.6% of the maternal serum quetiapine concentration.[5] A woman was taking quetiapine 100 mg each night for treatment of bipolar disorder during 2 pregnancies. and during breastfeeding. She breastfed both preterm infants and on 2 days, milk was pumped 1 hour after the dose, at the presumed time of the peak milk quetiapine level and given to the infant. Infant serum levels were measured one hour after the breastmilk intake on 2 separate occasions. In one infant, serum quetiapine levels were   < 1 and 3 mcg/L on days 6 and 33 of age, respectively. In the second infant, serum quetiapine levels were 0 (  < 0.096 mcg/L) and 15 mcg/L on days 4 and 6 of age, respectively.[9]"

At 6 weeks the infant was doing well. No further follow-up was reported.[10] Another infant whose mother was taking 200 mg daily of quetiapine began to exclusively breastfeed at 8 weeks of age. The infant was developing well at 4.5 months of age and no adverse effects were reported.[1] A nursing mother with postpartum psychosis was started on quetiapine at 6 weeks postpartum at a dose of 25 mg daily along with unspecified benzodiazepines. The quetiapine dosage was increased gradually to 200 mg daily over the next 6 weeks and up to 300 mg daily over the ensuing 4 weeks (16 weeks postpartum). She was also started on mirtazapine 15 mg daily at 8 weeks postpartum. Breastfeeding (extent not specified) was continued until 16 weeks postpartum when it was stopped because of reduced milk production. During this time the infant was excessively drowsy until the benzodiazepine dosage was deceased at the same time as the quetiapine dosage was increased. The infant was followed for at least 2 months after breastfeeding ended and no effects on the infant's growth, motor or psychological development or signs of infant withdrawal were noted.[11]A nursing mother with bipolar disorder began taking 20 mg of paroxetine at 4 months postpartum and was then started on quetiapine 200 mg twice daily at 6 months postpartum. She breastfed regularly (extent not stated) and no obvious adverse effects were noted in the infant.[12] A woman who was treated chronically with quetiapine 400 mg and fluvoxamine 200 mg daily took the drugs throughout pregnancy and postpartum. She partially breastfed her infant (extent not stated) for 3 months from birth. No adverse events were seen and the infant developed normally.[13] Six nursing mothers took quetiapine in doses of 25 to 400 mg daily in addition to an antidepressant (usually paroxetine) for major depression postpartum. Their breastfed infants' development were tested at 9 to 18 months of age with the Bayley scales. Measurements were slightly low on the mental and psychomotor development scale in one infant and on the mental development scale in another. All other scores were within normal limits. The authors concluded that the low scores of the 2 infants were probably not caused by the drugs received by the infants in breastmilk.[2] An infant was born to a mother taking quetiapine 400 mg daily, fluoxetine 40 mg daily and oxycodone 20 mg 3 times daily. The infant was breastfed 6 to 7 times daily and was receiving 120 mcg of oral morphine 3 times daily for opiate withdrawal. Upon examination at 3 months of age, the infant's weight was at the 25th percentile for age, having been at the 50th percentile at birth. The authors attributed the weight loss to opiate withdrawal. The infant's Denver developmental score was equal to his chronological age.[3]One 60-week-old infant who was 50% breastfed was breastfed during maternal therapy with quetiapine 75 mg daily mg daily and venlafaxine 225 mg daily. No adverse reactions were reported by the mother or in the medical records.[14] A woman with bipolar disorder who delivered twins and was taking sodium valproate in a therapeutic dosage was started on quetiapine 200 mg and olanzapine 15 mg at 11 pm daily after 20 days postpartum. She withheld breastfeeding during the night and discarded milk pumped at 7 am. She then breastfed her infants until 11 pm. The mother continued feeding the infants on this schedule for 15 months. Monthly follow-up of the infants indicated normal growth and neither the pediatricians nor the parents noted any adverse effects in the infants.[8] A mother taking quetiapine 100 mg each night for bipolar disorder breastfed 2 successive preterm infants. Both infants were reported to be developing normally at their last follow-up visits (exact times not specified).[9]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Unlike the phenothiazines, quetiapine has a minimal effect on serum prolactin levels.[15][16][17] Galactorrhea occurred in a woman who was not breastfeeding while she was taking venlafaxine 112.5 mg daily and quetiapine. Galactorrhea occurred 10 days after her quetiapine dose was increased to 50 mg daily a few days after starting the drug at 12.5 mg daily. Her serum prolactin level was 27.3 mcg/L (normal 2 to 30 mcg/L) and decreased to 8.5 mcg/L 2 weeks after discontinuing the drug. Galactorrhea ceased 1 week later.[18] The maternal prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

Results indicated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.84% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of risperidone and another 3.46% as 9-hydroxyrisperidone for a total of 4.3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[1] Two breastfeeding women taking 2 mg twice daily and 1.5 mg daily in 2 divided doses, respectively, and another with risperidone-induced galactorrhea taking 3 mg once daily were studied. Both risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured in milk. Milk levels of the drugs were rather flat during the 12 to 24 hours after the dose. The mean dose that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive was calculated to be 3.3% (range 2.2 to 4.7%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[2] A woman who was 1 week postpartum was started on oral risperidone 2 mg daily and increased to 3 mg once daily. On day 6 of therapy (dosage 2 mg daily) average milk levels at 3 hours after a dose were risperidone 2.5 mcg/L and 9-hydroxyrisperidone 10 mcg/L. On day 10 (dosage 2 mg daily) at 15 hours after a dose 9-hydroxyrisperidone averaged 1.2 mcg/L and risperidone was undetectable. On day 20 of therapy (dosage 3 mg daily) average milk levels at 16 hours after a dose were risperidone 0.1 mcg/L and 9-hydroxyrisperidone 2.5 mcg/L.[3] A woman took risperidone during pregnancy and breastfeeding. At 3 months postpartum, she provided 6 foremilk samples over a 24-hour period after her daily dose while she was taking a dose of 1 mg daily. Milk was analyzed for risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone by HPLC. Risperidone could not be detected in milk (assay limit not specified). Breastmilk 9-hydroxyrisperidone was about 3 mcg/L at 1 and 24 hours later; its concentration was about 4 mcg/L at 2, 4, 8, 18 and 23 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive 4.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage as 9-hydroxyrisperidone.[4] Infant Levels. In 2 breastfed infants (6 weeks and 3.3 months old) whose mothers were taking 2 mg twice daily and 1.5 mg daily in 2 divided doses, respectively, risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone were both undetectable (  < 1 mcg/L) in the serums of the infants.[2] An infant was breastfed 6 times daily during maternal therapy with risperidone 2 mg once daily. Fifteen hours after the mother's last dose, the infant's plasma levels of risperidone was undetectable and 9-hydroxyrisperidone was 0.1 mcg/L.[3] An infant was exclusively breastfed on demand during maternal therapy with risperidone 1 mg daily.

The authors estimated that the maximum dosage that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive would be 0.56 mg daily, equivalent to 0.23% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Additionally, comparing infants who were breastfed to those who were not, the serum tacrolimus concentrations fell at about the same rate over the first 2 weeks postpartum, regardless of breastfeeding status, indicating that breastfeeding did not prolong infant tacrolimus levels[12]Eleven breastmilk samples were obtained via breast pump over a 12-hour dosage interval in a nursing mother who was 45 weeks postpartum and receiving tacrolimus 1.5 mg twice daily after a liver transplant.

Tacrolimus was undetectable (  < 1.9 mcg/L) in all of the infants.[13] A woman was taking tacrolimus 6 mg twice daily during pregnancy to prevent rejection of an small intestine transplant. Her dosage was adjusted to maintain an optimal tacrolimus blood level postpartum, although the exact dosage was not stated. She breastfed (extent not stated) her infant and at 1 week of age, the infant's tacrolimus blood level was less than 1 mcg/L.[14] Twelve infants were exclusively breastfed by mothers taking tacrolimus (exact dosages not specified) during pregnancy and postpartum. Twenty-four infant blood samples were obtained from the infants at various times. The median infant blood tacrolimus concentration was 1.3 mcg/L (range 0.0-4.0 mcg/L). In infants in whom serial blood levels were obtained, levels declined at about 15% daily. Blood tacrolimus levels in breastfed infants were no higher than those in 3 additional infants who were not breastfed. Eight breast-fed infants with serial blood samples had undetectable (  < 0.1 mcg/L) tacrolimus blood levels at a median of day 14 (interquartile range day 11-22) postpartum.[12] Two mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus were reported who took tacrolimus during pregnancy and lactation. One took tacrolimus 3 mg and prednisolone 40 mg daily and the other took tacrolimus 3 mg and prednisolone 30 mg daily during breastfeeding.

Newborn and especially preterm infants are most likely to be affected because of their slow elimination and low serum protein binding of theophylline. There is no need to avoid theophylline products; however, keep maternal serum concentrations in the lower part of the therapeutic range and monitor the infant for signs of theophylline side effects. Infant serum theophylline concentrations can help to determine if signs of agitation are due to theophylline. Avoiding breastfeeding for an 2 hours after intravenous or 4 hours after an immediate-release oral theophylline product can decrease the dose received by the breastfed infant. When theophylline is given as an oral sustained-release product, timing of nursing with respect to the dose is of little or no benefit."

Peak milk levels occur 1 to 3 hours after oral ingestion of immediate-release products and almost immediately after intravenous administration.

Theophylline is found in the serum of breastfed infants.[4] In newborn infants with typical theophylline clearance rates, infant serum levels are expected to be between 1 and 4 mg/L with a maternal serum level in the therapeutic range of 10 to 20 mg/L.[2] Infant serum levels might occasionally accumulate to therapeutic levels in infants with slow clearance rates of the drug.[5]"

Another five infants reported in this paper showed no adverse reactions after maternal theophylline ingestion.[3] Accumulation of theophylline in infant serum appears most likely in neonates and premature infants because they eliminate theophylline slowly.[2][5]"

She had 5.7 mg of betamethasone sodium phosphate and acetate mixture injected into her shoulder for bursitis with no effect on lactation. Four weeks later, she continued to have pain in her thoracic cervical regions and was diagnosed with neural sensitization. She had 80 to 120 mg of triamcinolone diacetate injected into her cervical and thoracic spine epidurally and into the facets. Three days later, she noticed a decrease in milk supply and a reduced ejection reflex which continued to worsen over the next 5 days. She began using a breast pump with frequent pumping and domperidone as a galactogogue. Her milk slowly increased over several days and was normal by 21 days after the injection when she stopped domperidone. At that time, her serum prolactin levels were elevated.[2] The decrease in the mother's milk supply was possibly caused by the corticosteroid injections. A dose of depot methylprednisolone injected into the wrist has also been reported to cause temporary cessation of lactation.[5] A study of 46 women who delivered an infant before 34 weeks of gestation found that a course of another corticosteroid (betamethasone, 2 intramuscular injections of 11.4 mg of betamethasone 24 hours apart) given between 3 and 9 days before delivery resulted in delayed lactogenesis II and lower average milk volumes during the 10 days after delivery. Milk volume was not affected if the infant was delivered less than 3 days or more than 10 days after the mother received the corticosteroid.[6] An equivalent dosage regimen of triamcinolone might have the same effect. A study of 87 pregnant women found that betamethasone given as above during pregnancy caused a premature stimulation of lactose secretion during pregnancy. Although the increase was statistically significant, the clinical importance appears to be minimal.[7] An equivalent dosage regimen of triamcinolone might have the same effect."

The infant was hospitalized and had periods of somnolence and irritability and required intravenous anticonvulsants to control seizures. An MRI was consistent with encephalitis. Yellow fever-specific IgM antibodies were detected in serum and CSF. Laboratory examination of the infant's cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the presence of a viral strain identical to the vaccine. This was the first case of laboratory-confirmed, breastfeeding-associated transmission of 17DD yellow fever vaccine virus from a recently vaccinated mother.[1] A Canadian mother had received a yellow fever vaccination (probably the 17D-204 strain) when her breastfed (extent not stated) infant was 10 days of age. At 5 weeks of age, the infant developed focal seizures on alternating sides, poor appetite, and vomiting following a 2-day history of fever and irritability. The infant's serum was positive for yellow fever and the cerebrospinal fluid was positive for yellow fever antigen, but negative for yellow fever virus. Although the authors could not entirely rule out other causes, they judged the adverse reaction to probably be caused by yellow fever vaccine transmitted via breastmilk to the infant.[4]"

Those with low binding such as acebutolol (25%) are more extensively excreted into breastmilk.[4] Diacetolol is a renally excreted metabolite with equal beta-blocking activity that is more extensively excreted into breastmilk than acebutolol. In newborn infants, the apparent half-lives of acebutolol and diacetolol averaged 10.1 to 15.6 hours and 19.8 hours, respectively.[5][6] It is estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive about 3.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of acebutolol.[7] Maternal Levels:One mother with renal impairment taking 400 mg/day of acebutolol 3 days postpartum had milk levels of 1.5 mg/L of acebutolol and 2.6 mg/L of diacetolol at an unspecified time after the dose.

Timing breastfeeding with respect to the time of the atenolol dose appears to be of little benefit in reducing infant atenolol exposure because the time of the peak is unpredictable.[3]"
    drug_levels: "The excretion of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs into breastmilk is largely determined by their protein binding. Those with low binding such as atenolol at 10% are more extensively excreted into breastmilk. Accumulation of the drugs in the infant is related to the fraction excreted in urine. With 85% renal excretion, atenolol presents a high risk for accumulation in infants, especially neonates. Maternal Levels: The time of the peak milk level of atenolol varied between 2 and 8 hours after the dose in 5 women.[4][5][6] In one woman a peak level of 1.6 mg/L occurred 4 hours after a single 50 mg dose.[5] After a single dose of 100 mg of atenolol in 4 women 4 to 12 days postpartum, peak milk levels ranged from 1.4 to 2.1 mg/L.[6] In 6 women taking atenolol 100 mg/day, two milk samples were taken in one day at unstated times after the dose. Milk levels ranged from 0.025 to 2.1 mg/L (average 0.7 mg/L).[7] In a study of 5 early postpartum women, single milk levels taken 2 hours after a dose ranged from 0.38 to 1.04 mg/L (average 0.63 mg/L) with a dosage of 100 mg/day.[8] Because of the single early sample taken, these probably do not represent the peak milk levels in these women. Another woman taking atenolol 50 mg twice daily had an atenolol milk levels of 469 mcg/L 1.5 hours after a dose which probably does not represent the peak milk level.[9] It is estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive between 5.7 and 19.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of atenolol.[10] Nine women taking atenolol in dosages ranging between 25 and 200 mg daily (average not stated) in 2 divided doses had milk atenolol levels averaging 464 mcg/L at 2 hours after a dose. There was a 53% coefficient of variation in the levels measured, in part due to the wide range of dosages.[11] Breastfeeding women taking oral atenolol for hypertension were studied during 3 time periods: 2-4 weeks postpartum, 3-4 months postpartum and 6-8 months postpartum. Seventeen women were evaluated at all time periods, 22 at the two earlier times, and 32 at 2-4 weeks postpartum. The excretion of atenolol into breastmilk decreased over time, with the average weight-adjusted percentages of maternal dosage of 9%, 5.1% and 3.2% at the 3 time periods, respectively. The highest percentages in individual infants were 34.8% at 2-4 weeks and 17.8% at 3-4 months of age. The absolute dose that breastfed infants received were proportional to the maternal dosage. Peak concentrations of atenolol in breastmilk occurred at an average of 4.4 hours after the dose, but in some individuals, the peak concentration occurred as late as 12 hours after the previousdose just before the next dose .[3] Infant Levels.After a single 50 mg maternal atenolol dose, the serum level in one 2-week-old infant was undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) 4 hours after nursing when the milk concentration was 1.8 mg/L.[5] Another 2-week-old infant had serum levels of 0, 0 and 69 mcg/L just prior to nursing at three times: before, 2.25 hours and 6.25 hours after the maternal dose of atenolol 100 mg/day.[12][13] One infant had undetectable (assay limits not stated) whole blood and plasma levels of atenolol at 3 and 8 days of age, respectively, with a maternal dose of 100 mg/day, although sampling times were not stated.[14] In 3 infants, atenolol serum levels ranged from undetectable (  < 27 mcg/L) to 116 mcg/L 4 and 8 hours after a 100 mg maternal dose of atenolol.[6] In one 10-day-old infant with symptoms of beta-blockade, serum atenolol levels were 2 mg/L 48 hours after the last nursing and 0.14 mg/L 72 hours after nursing was discontinued. The infant's mother was taking atenolol 50 mg twice daily.[9] Urine atenolol levels of 20, 30 and 435 mcg/L were found in 3 infants whose mothers were taking 100 mg/day.[7][15] In another 8-day-old breastfed infant, a urine atenolol level of 440 mcg/L was measured during maternal use of atenolol 100 mg/day.[14] Atenolol serum concentrations were below the lower limit of the assay (10 mcg/L) in 22 breastfed (extent not stated) infants aged 3 to 4 months whose mothers were taking atenolol in an average oral dosage of 49 mg daily.[3]"

    drug_levels: "Chloroquine has a serum half-life of over a month. Some studies have sampled milk after only a few doses before steady state was reached, making interpretation of some of the data difficult. The active metabolite, desethylchloroquine, has been measured in only a few studies. Maternal Levels: Milk chloroquine levels were measured in one mother after an oral regimen of 600 mg/day of chloroquine base for 2 days, followed by 300 mg/day for 3 days. Average milk levels of 1.2 mg/L (range 0.2 to 2.8 mg/L) were detected in 17 random samples during, and 4 days following the doses. Metabolite levels averaged 0.68 mg/L (range 0.1 to 1.5 mg/L).[3]In 9 women given a total dose of 25 mg/kg of chloroquine base over 3 days (10, 10 and 5 mg/kg) for malaria treatment, up to 8 breastmilk samples were obtained over the following 28 days. Chloroquine was still detectable in milk 28 days after the last dose.[4]Three women were given a single dose of chloroquine base 600 mg orally 2 to 5 days postpartum. Milk samples were obtained periodically for about 9 days after the dose and area-under-the-curve values were calculated; milk levels were not reported. Assuming a daily intake of 1 L of milk, the authors calculated that the 3 infants would receive 0.4, 0.58 and 0.76 mg in milk over the study period. These values equate to an average of 3.1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[5]After a single 5 mg/kg intramuscular dose of chloroquine phosphate in 6 women who were 17 days postpartum, milk chloroquine levels averaged 227 mg/L (range 192 to 319 mg/L) 2 hours after the dose. No other milk levels were obtained.[6]Six women who were 2 to 2.5 months postpartum were given a single dose of 300 mg of chloroquine base orally. The peak chloroquine level in milk averaging 3.97 mg/L occurred 3 hours after the dose. The elimination half-life from milk averaged 132 hours. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.55% of the mothers total (nonweight-adjusted) dose in 24 hours.[7]Eleven women were given 600 mg of chloroquine base orally. The peak chloroquine plus desethylchloroquine in milk averaging 4.4 mg/L occurred an average of 14.4 hours after the dose. Chloroquine and desethylchloroquine were detected in the urine of the 4 infants who were tested. Using the peak milk concentration, the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a maximum of 14% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. The elimination half-life from milk averaged 8.8 days.[8]Ten women who were taking oral chloroquine 300 mg/week of chloroquine during pregnancy were changed to a dose of 100 mg/day for the last 10 days of pregnancy and first 10 days postpartum. Milk samples were taken daily for 3 days during the first 10 days postpartum at the end of nursing (time after dose unspecified). The median whole milk concentration was 352 mcg/L. The milk was separated into cell-rich and cell-poor fractions. The cell-rich fraction had a median chloroquine concentration of 746 mcg/L and colostrum cells had a calculated concentration of 81 mg/L. The authors hypothesized that the high concentration of chloroquine in the milk cells might protect the infants against HIV transmission.[9]The passage of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine into breastmilk was measured in 16 women who received 750 mg of chloroquine phosphate (equivalent to 465 mg base) daily for 3 consecutive days starting on the day of delivery for malaria prophylaxis. Fore- and hindmilk samples were obtained on postpartum days 3, 4, 5, 10 and 18 to 22. Concentrations of the drug and metabolite varied widely among the patients with average milk concentrations of 226 mcg/L (range 44 to 336 mcg/L) and  97 mcg/L (range 26 to 175 mcg/L), respectively. The average infant dosages were 34 mcg/kg daily (range 7 to 50 mcg/kg daily) for chloroquine and 97 mcg/kg daily (range 26 to 175 mcg/kg daily) for desethylchloroquine, which would be too low to provide effective malaria prophylaxis for the breastfed infant.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Early literature indicated some reluctance to allow breastfeeding during hydroxychloroquine use. Newer information indicates that infants exposed to hydroxychloroquine during breastfeeding receive only small amounts of the drug in breastmilk. In a small number of infants up to at least 1 year of age, careful follow-up found no adverse effects on growth, vision or hearing.[1][2] When given once weekly for malaria prophylaxis, the amount of drug is not sufficient to harm the infant nor is the quantity sufficient to protect the child from malaria. Breastfeeding infants should receive the recommended dosages of hydroxychloroquine for malaria prophylaxis.[3] <br><br>  A survey of US, Canadian, British and Mexican physician experts in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus completed prior to the publication of the above safety data indicated that 63% would allow breastfeeding in mothers who took an antimalarial during pregnancy and 53% would \"often\" or \"always\" advise a mother to breastfeed if the antimalarial were begun after delivery. Only 13% would have \"never\" advised breastfeeding in this circumstance.[4] Another review concluded that hydroxychloroquine could be used during lactation.[5]"
    drug_levels: "Hydroxychloroquine is usually available as the sulfate salt with hydroxychloroquine constituting about 75% of the labeled dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. It has a half-life of over a month. Some studies have not been clear about the salt form and dosage of the products being taken and others have sampled milk after only a few doses before steady state was reached. These flaws make interpretation of some of the data difficult. Maternal Levels: In a patient beginning therapy with 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine (salt unspecified) twice daily, the highest milk level detected was 10.6 mcg/L from 3 to 12 hours after the fourth dose. After the first 48 hours of treatment with a total dosage of 800 mg, a total of 3.2 mcg was excreted into her breastmilk. This amounted to 0.0003% of the mother's total dosage.[6] However, it is unlikely that steady state had been reached at this time. A woman who had been breastfeeding for 9 months began taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg (equivalent to 310 mg hydroxychloroquine base) nightly. After 6 weeks of this regimen, steady-state milk levels were 1.46, 1.09, 1.09 and 0.85 mg/L at 2, 9.5, 14 after one dose and 17.7 hours after a dose on the next day. The authors estimated that the infant would receive 0.11 mg/kg daily or about 2% of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.[7] Two women who had taken hydroxychloroquine 200 mg (probably sulfate equivalent to 150 mg of base) once or twice daily (the report is unclear) before and during pregnancy had milk levels measured after delivery. Hydroxychloroquine levels in the two mothers were 344 and 1424 mcg/L at unspecified times after a dose. The authors estimated an infant intake of 0.06 and 0.2 mg/kg daily in the two infants.[8] These authors also reported two other women who had milk hydroxychloroquine levels of 1131 and 1392 mcg/L at unreported times after unspecified doses (presumably 200 to 400 mg daily). The authors estimated that these two infants would receive no more than 0.2 mg/kg daily via breastmilk.[9]Numerous samples of milk were obtained from 6 women who were receiving 400 mg (n = 5) or 200 mg (n = 1) of hydroxychloroquine daily. The average milk level was of 376 mcg/L (range 20-1463 mcg/L) of hydroxychloroquine and of 36 mcg/L (range 11-111 mcg/L) of desethylchloroquine. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive 1 mg of hydroxychloroquine and 0.066 mg of desethylchloroquine daily.[10] Infant Levels. Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "No adverse effects were reported in one 9-month-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking 310 mg hydroxychloroquine base daily for 6 weeks.[7] Five mothers took hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily during pregnancy and breastfeeding, one for 30 months. Flash electroretinograms performed on the infants were normal.[1][11] Another group of investigators have reported numerous infants whose mother took hydroxychloroquine during pregnancy and were breastfed during maternal hydroxychloroquine use. An abstract reported 16 infants breastfed for 1 to 19 months and followed up at an average of 24 months (range 1 to 86 months) with no evidence of visual or hearing deficits.[12] In a letter they reported 8 breastfed infants followed up at 1, 6 and 12 months of age who had normal growth and development and who had thorough, normal eye examinations at 1 and 12 months of age.[13] In a case series, 13 mothers taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg daily breastfed their infants for an average of 2.8 months (range 1 to 6 months). None had evidence of retinal, motor or growth abnormalities during 12 months of follow-up. The authors conclude that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risk of hydroxychloroquine.[2] It appears that the 8 infants reported in the letter were included among the 13 infants in the case series, but it is unclear whether the 16 infants reported in the abstract were part of the case series."

One of the women who took labetalol 400 mg daily for 5 weeks had no detectable drug in breastmilk (assay limit not specified). In another 9 women taking 600 to 800 mg daily, the average random milk level was 41 mcg/L. In one patient taking 1200 mg daily, a random milk level of 600 mcg/L was found.[2] Peak milk levels averaging 70 mcg/L were found after a single 200 mg oral dose in 9 women.[3] Peak milk levels of 129, 223 and 662 mcg/L were found in 3 women taking 600, 600 and 1200 mg daily, respectively.[4] Peak milk levels occur 1 to 3 hours after the dose.[3][4] Infant Levels.

The mother was taking labetalol 300 mg twice daily by mouth for hypertension. Bradycardia and premature beats resolved within 24 hours of substitution of formula for breastmilk. No other causes for the bradycardia could be identified. One untimed sample of the mother's breastmilk contained 710 mcg/L of labetalol.[6] Although the authors estimated the infant's dose to be 100 mg/kg daily, a recalculation using their data indicates that the infant's dose was only 100 mcg/kg daily."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Although lithium appears on many lists of drugs contraindicated during breastfeeding, other sources do not consider it a contraindication, especially in infants over 2 months of age and during lithium monotherapy. Numerous reports exist of infants who were breastfed during maternal lithium therapy without any signs of toxicity or developmental problems. Most were breastfed from birth and some continued to nurse for up to 1 year of maternal lithium therapy. Limited data suggest that lithium in milk can adversely affect the infant when its elimination is impaired, as in dehydration or in newborn or premature infants. Neonates may also have transplacentally acquired serum lithium levels. The long-term effects of lithium on infants are not known, but limited data indicate no obvious problems in growth and development.[1]<br><br>  Lithium may be used in mothers of fullterm infants who are willing and able to monitor their infants. Discontinuing lithium 24 to 48 hours before Cesarean section delivery or at the onset of spontaneous labor and resuming the prepregnancy lithium dose immediately after delivery should minimize the infant's serum lithium concentration at birth.[2] Some investigators recommend monitoring infant serum lithium, serum creatinine, BUN, and TSH every 4 to 12 weeks during breastfeeding and maternal lithium therapy.[3][4] However, others recommend close pediatric follow-up of the infant and only selective laboratory monitoring as clinically indicated.[2] Breastfeeding should be discontinued immediately and the infant evaluated if the infant appears restless or lethargic or has feeding problems.[2]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Most older reports of lithium levels in breastmilk did not characterized breastmilk lithium excretion in a rigorous manner. Random milk levels have been reported to range from 0.12 to 0.7 mEq/L and appear to be rather consistent at about 40 to 45% of the simultaneous maternal serum level.[5][6][7][8] The milk concentration of lithium in one woman was found to be inversely proportional to milk volume. The milk to plasma ratio was found to be directly proportional to serum lithium; the ratio was about 1 with low serum lithium and 1.5 with higher serum lithium levels, indicating disproportionately higher lithium excretion into milk with higher serum levels.[9] From data in papers published up to 1990 concerning 6 infants, it is estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive about 26% (range 11 to 42%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of lithium.[6][7][8][9][10][11]A more recent case series of 11 mothers found the average infant dosage to be 12.2% (range 0 to 30%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[12] The reason for the difference between the older and more recent data is not apparent.A case series reported 10 mothers taking lithium carbonate in an average daily dosage of 850 mg (range 600 to 1200 mg daily) for bipolar disorder. Lithium milk levels in 26 milk samples taken between 8.1 and 27.5 weeks postpartum averaged 0.35 mEq/L (range 0.19 to 0.48 mEq/L). No difference was found between concentrations in fore- and hindmilk samples.[4]One woman who was taking 1200 mg of lithium carbonate daily (dosage schedule and product not reported) had a milk lithium concentration of 0.41 mmol/L at 20 hours after her previous dose. This was about the same as her simultaneous blood concentration.[13] Infant Levels. The serum lithium levels in the breastfed infants of mothers taking lithium have ranged from 10 to 50% of simultaneous maternal serum lithium levels.[6][10][12][14] One infant, who previously had a serum level about 50% of the mother's, became dehydrated and developed a serum level that was double that of the mother's.[14]Ten exclusively breastfed infants whose mothers were taking an average of 850 mg daily of lithium carbonate had serum levels of 0.16 mEq/L or 24% (range 11 to 56%) of maternal serum levels.[4]Two breastfed infants (extent not stated) were reported whose mothers were taking lithium carbonate during pregnancy and postpartum. The first mother was taking 1200 mg daily and the infant's serum concentrations were 0.11 mmol/L on day on day 4 and undetectable (  < 0.1 mmol/L) on days 6 and 10 postpartum. The second mother was taking 900 mg daily and her breastfed infants's serum lithium concentration was undetectable (  < 0.3 mmol/L) on day 3 of life. Both infants had other serum concentration measurements that were in the therapeutic or toxic ranges, but displayed no symptoms. These samples apparently had been collected in tubes containing lithium heparin.[13] A woman took lithium carbonate orally 800 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum while exclusively breastfeeding her infant. The mother had a serum lithium concentration of 0.74 mmol/L at 15 days postpartum. The infant's serum lithium concentration was 0.26 mmol/L at this time. Further serum lithium concentrations in the infant were 0.23 mmol/L at 1 and 2 months of age and 0.17 mmol/L at 6 months of age.[15] Three mothers took lithium carbonate during pregnancy and breastfeeding. One mother took a dosage of 900 mg daily during 2 pregnancies. Her infants' serum lithium concentrations were 0.08 mEq/L at 31 days and 183 days postpartum in the first pregnancy and 0.11 mEq/L at 43 days of age in the second pregnancy. These values were 11%, 17% and 15% of the mother's simultaneous serum lithium concentrations, respectively. The second mother also took a dosage of 900 mg daily. Her infant's serum lithium concentration was 0.08 mEq/L at 39 days postpartum, or 10% of the mother's simultaneous serum lithium concentration. The third mother took a dosage of 1350 mg daily. Her infant's serum lithium concentration was 0.11 mEq/L at 31 days postpartum, or 11% of the mother's simultaneous serum lithium concentration.[2] A woman with bipolar disorder was taking lithium 600 to 900 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. At 10 days postpartum, her infant's serum lithium level was 0.26 mmol/L, which was 58% of the maternal trough serum level. Lithium was discontinued. First quetiapine then aripiprazole were substituted for lithium, but after 2 to 3 weeks she switched back to lithium at an unspecified dosage. After several weeks of treatment, her infant's lithium level was 0.2 mmol/L.[16]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In older reports, at least 24 infants have been reported to have been breastfed during maternal lithium therapy without any signs of toxicity or developmental problems. All were breastfed from birth and some continued to nurse for up to 6 months of maternal lithium therapy.[4][6][7][8][12][13][15] A 5-day-old infant developed cyanosis, lethargy, ECG T-wave inversion probably caused by lithium in breastmilk.[10] The mother had been receiving the long-acting diuretic chlorthalidone prior to delivery which probably decreased the infant's lithium elimination and increased the neonate's lithium serum levels. Another case of probable infant lithium intoxication appeared only after the infant had a cold which may have led to dehydration and decreased lithium excretion.[14][17] Two other infants had slight increases in thyrotropin (TSH) levels at 8 and 4 weeks of age, respectively, after lithium exposure that began during pregnancy. Elevated TSH continued until maternal lithium was stopped in one,[4] and normalized by 2 months postpartum in the other, despite continued exclusive breastfeeding.[15] Three mothers took lithium carbonate during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The first infant was born to a mother who also took bupropion 300 mg and levothyroxine 50 to 75 mcg daily. She breastfed beyond 1 year of age. Her infant did not regain birth weight by 15 days of age, was somewhat hypotonic at 2 months of age, and was treated for gross and fine motor delay for the first year of life. The mother had a second infant on the same drug regimen. She exclusively breastfed her infant who developed normally without hypotonia. A second mother was taking a lithium dosage of 900 mg daily. Her infant gained weight slowly, but weight gain increased with breastfeeding support and she exclusively breastfed her infant for 4 months. A third mother was taking 1350 mg of lithium daily as well as escitalopram 10 mg, levothyroxine 25 mcg and heparin (dosage not stated) daily during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Her infant was normal and was exclusively breastfed until 8 weeks of age when the maternal serum lithium concentration was excessive at 2.0 mEq/L. Breastfeeding was withheld for 2 days and the dosage lowered to 600 mg daily. She then breastfed successfully until 7 months of age.[2]"

In addition, because interferon is poorly absorbed orally, it is not likely to reach the bloodstream of the infant. A small number of nursing mothers receiving interferon beta-1a while  partially breastfeeding their infants and one woman exclusively breastfed her infant while taking interferon beta-1b and reported no adverse effects. The Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Excellence on Reproduction and Child Health considers interferon beta to be \"moderately safe\" to use during breastfeeding,[1] and a French consensus group of neurologists concluded that interferon beta can be used during breastfeeding.[2] No special precautions appear to be required during breastfeeding while using interferon beta. Holder pasteurization (62.5 degrees C for 30 minutes) decreases the concentration of endogenous interferon-gamma by an average about 10%.[3]"

Eleven days later, breastmilk levels of amitriptyline and nortriptyline were 135 and 52 mcg/L, respectively, 14 hours after the dose.[2] The amounts in milk represent an infant dosage of about 1.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Amitriptyline and nortriptyline were measured in breastmilk in a mother who was taking amitriptyline 75 mg daily. Her milk amitriptyline levels were 104 and 72 mcg/L and her nortriptyline levels were 75 and 63 mcg/L at 2 and 10 weeks, respectively, after starting treatment (time after dose not specified). After 19 weeks of therapy, an amitriptyline dose of 25 mg daily produced milk amitriptyline levels of 30 mcg/L; nortriptyline levels were not detectable (  < 30 mcg/L). The authors estimated that this infant would receive 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[3]Another mother who was taking amitriptyline 175 mg daily had amitriptyline and nortriptyline milk levels of 13 and 15 mcg/L each on the morning and evening of the first day of therapy. On days 2 to 26 of therapy, milk amitriptyline ranged from 23 to 38 mcg/L. On day 26 milk nortriptyline was about 64 mcg/L. E-10-hydroxynortriptyline was found in milk in levels averaging 89 mcg/L over this 26-day time period.[4]A 2-week postpartum mother of a preterm infant had been taking amitriptyline 100 mg daily for 4 days when milk was analyzed. Milk amitriptyline levels were highest at 1.5 and 6 hours after the dose at 103 and 100 mcg/L, respectively. They fell to 29 mcg/L 24 hours after the dose. Milk nortriptyline levels were highest at 18 hours after the dose at 58 mcg/L.[5] Using the peak milk level data from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated maximum of 0.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.Two mothers who were taking amitriptyline had milk samples taken 12 to 15 hours after their daily dose. The mother taking 100 mg daily had a foremilk level of 30 mcg/L and a hindmilk level of 113 mcg/L. The mother taking 175 mg daily had a hindmilk level of 197 mcg/L.[6] Using the hindmilk data from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated maximum of 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Infant Levels:  A mother who had been taking amitriptyline 150 mg daily for 3 weeks was nursing her infant (extent not stated).

Milk levels taken 10 to 14 hours after the 150 mg dose on days 10, 14 and 35 were 270, 305 and 624 mcg/L, respectively. Using the average of the above concentrations, a fully breastfed infant would receive about 2.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of clomipramine in breastmilk.[1] In a study of 2 mothers, concentrations of clomipramine were measured in the milk 12 to 15 hours after the dose. In one who was taking 100 mg daily, the level in foremilk was 60 mcg/L and in hindmilk was 226 mcg/L. The other woman was taking 75, 100 and then 125 mg daily. Three measurements of milk clomipramine on the 125 mg dose averaged 148 mcg/L (range 98 to 212 mcg/L) in foremilk and 202 mcg/L (range 136 to 250 mcg/L) in hindmilk. Using the average of the above fore- and hindmilk concentrations, a fully breastfed infant would receive about 1.3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of clomipramine in breastmilk.[2] A woman was treated with clomipramine 25 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. At 33 days postpartum, a breastmilk sample table 12 to 15 hours after the dose contained clomipramine in a concentration of 55.1 mcg/L. Desmethylclomipramine concentration was undetectable (  < 50 mcg/L) in breastmilk.[3] Infant Levels. An infant was born with a serum clomipramine level of 267 mcg/L because of transplacental passage. Breastfeeding was instituted on day 7 postpartum during maternal use of clomipramine 150 mg daily. Infant serum clomipramine levels 10 to 14 hours after the mother's dose on days 10, 14 and 35 were 45, 24 and 10 mcg/L, respectively.[1]Two infants whose mothers were taking clomipramine from 1 and 3 weeks postpartum had plasma levels of clomipramine and its major active metabolites obtained at unspecified ages. The drugs were undetectable (  <  0.1 mcg/L) in the plasma of an infant whose mother was taking 100 mg daily. In the infant whose mother was taking 75, 100 and then 125 mg daily, the infant had a combined drug and metabolite plasma level of 3.2 mcg/L with a maternal dosage of 75 mg daily. The infant plasma level was 5.5 mcg/L in one instance on a dose of 125 mg daily and undetectable in 3 instances with maternal dosages of 100, 125 and 125 mg daily.[2] Infant serum levels were measured in 4 breastfed infants (one fully breastfed; extent not stated in the other 3) aged 2, 3, 18 and 19 weeks during maternal use of clomipramine 75 to 125 mg daily. Infant serum levels 10 to 12 hours after the maternal dose were undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) for clomipramine and its 3 main active metabolites.[4] A newborn infant was exclusively breastfed by his mother who was taking clomipramine 5 mg daily. Infant serum obtained 12 to 15 hours after the mother's last dose contained undetectable (  < 50 mcg/L) amounts of clomipramine and its metabolite, desmethylclomipramine.[3]"

Some of the mothers were taking clomipramine.[7] An infant was born to a mother who had taken clomipramine 25 mg daily during pregnancy. The infant exhibited inadaptation syndrome for the first few days of life. However, the infant was exclusively breastfed while the mother continued clomipramine at the same dose postpartum. At 33 days of life, the infant exhibited no clinical signs of clomipramine side effects.[3] In an observational case series of 10 infants whose mothers were taking clomipramine in daily dosages ranging from 37.5 to 125 mg daily throughout pregnancy, all infants exhibited withdrawal symptoms after birth. Five of the 10 infants were breastfed, but no difference in withdrawal symptoms was seen between breastfed and non-breastfed infants. In 5 of the infants, 4 of who were breastfed, the half-life was calculated to average 42 hours (range 27 to 68 hours). The half-life in the non-breastfed infant was 35 hours, which was not statistically different from the breastfed infants. The authors attribute the lack of differences in withdrawal and half-life between breastfed and non-breastfed infants to the small amount of drug that is excreted into breastmilk.[8]"

Her milk levels were 75 and 63 mcg/L at 2 and 10 weeks, respectively, after starting treatment (time after dose not specified). After 19 weeks of therapy, an amitriptyline dose of 25 mg daily produced milk nortriptyline levels that were not detectable (  < 30 mcg/L).[4] A mother began taking nortriptyline 125 mg daily immediately postpartum and exclusively breastfed her infant. Milk samples were taken 9 times over 36 hours on days 6 and 7 postpartum. Peak milk nortriptyline levels of about 220 mcg/L occurred 8 hours after the dose, and the average of the 9 milk levels was 180 mcg/L. Milk levels measured on days 20 and 48 postpartum while the mother was taking 125 mg and 75 mg daily, respectively, were similar to the levels on days 6 and 7. Milk levels taken after feeding were much higher than those taken before feeding, probably because of higher concentrations in the more fat-rich hindmilk. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 27 mcg/kg daily or 1.3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[5] Another mother who was taking amitriptyline 175 mg daily had nortriptyline milk levels of 17 and 20 mcg/L on the morning and evening of the fist day of therapy and 87 mcg/L on day 26 of therapy. E-10-hydroxynortriptyline was found in milk in levels averaging 89 mcg/L over this time period.[6] Infant Levels: In a pooled analysis of 32 mother-infant pairs from published and unpublished cases, the authors found that infants had an average of 10% (range 0 to 24%) of the nortriptyline plasma levels of the mothers'; 1 of the 32 infants had a plasma level greater than 10% of the mothers', which was defined by the authors as being elevated.[2] In mothers taking 75 to 150 mg/day of nortriptyline, E-10-hydroxynortriptyline was found in levels ranging from barely detectable (  < 4 mcg/L) to 16 mcg/L in the serum of 5 of 9 breastfed infants and Z-10-hydroxynortriptyline has been detected in levels ranging from barely detectable (  < 4 mcg/L) to 17 mcg/L in the serum of 5 of 9 breastfed infants.[7][8]"

    drug_levels: "Bupropion is metabolized to 3 metabolites (hydroxybupropion, erythrohydroxybupropion, threohydroxybupropion) with the antidepressant activity of each considered to be about 50% of bupropion's.[1] Maternal Levels. A mother who was 14 months postpartum was taking bupropion 100 mg three times daily. Milk samples were obtained before and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after the first daily dose of 100 mg. Peak bupropion levels of 181 and 189 mcg/L occurred at 1 and 2 hours after the dose, respectively. A peak hydroxybupropion level of 132 mcg/L occurred in milk 2 hours after the dose and peak threohydroxybupropion levels of 443 and 442 mcg/L occurred at 1 and 2 hours after the dose, respectively.[2] Ten women who were an average of 12.5 months postpartum and who did not nurse their infants after the start of bupropion therapy took sustained-release bupropion 150 mg daily for 3 days, then 300 mg daily for 4 days. On the seventh day, breastmilk levels of the drug and metabolites were measured at a median 2.5 hours (range 1 to 12 hours) after the last dose. Breastmilk levels were as follows: bupropion 45.2 mcg/L (range 4 to 168 mcg/L); hydroxybupropion 104.6 mcg/L (range 9 to 242 mcg/L); erythrohydroxybupropion 72.1 mcg/L (range 25.4 to 143 mcg/L); and threohydroxybupropion 459 mcg/L (range 193 to 1052 mcg/L). There was no correlation between the amount of these drugs excreted in milk and maternal or infant age, maternal body mass or breastfeeding frequency prior to the study. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 0.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of bupropion and an average of 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of bupropion plus metabolites with this maternal dosage regimen.[3] Four women were taking bupropion SR 150 mg or 300 mg for depression or smoking cessation. Maternal milk and serum concentrations were measured before a dose at steady-state and 2 hours after the dose; 2 women had samples taken on 2 separate occasions. Milk bupropion concentrations standardized to a 150 mg dose averaged 64.1 mcg/L (range   < 10 to 120 mcg/L); metabolites were not measured. The average infant dose (normalized to a 150 mg maternal dose) was estimated to be 21.5 mcg/day (range 5.1 to 31.1 mcg/day) which averaged 5.1% (range 1.4 to 10.6%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[4] The mother of a 6.5-month-old had been taking escitalopram 10 mg daily since birth and had begun extended-release bupropion 150 mg daily 3 weeks earlier. Stored milk samples from between 6 and 6.25 months postpartum contained bupropion in concentrations ranging from 15.8 mcg/L to 24.4 mcg/L and hydroxybupropion in concentrations ranging from 46 mcg/L to 87 mcg/L.[5] Infant Levels: Bupropion and its metabolites were undetectable (  < 5 mcg/L for buproion and   < 20 mcg/L for its metabolites) in one 14-month-old infant 3.7 hours after nursing and 9.5 hours after the mother's last dose. The infant was nursing twice daily and his mother was taking 100 mg three times a day.[2] One 15-week postpartum mother was taking immediate-release bupropion 75 mg twice daily. After 2 weeks of therapy and full breastfeeding, serum levels of bupropion (  < 5 mcg/L) and hydroxybupropion (  < 100 mcg/L) were undetectable in her infant 2 hours after nursing and after the mother's dose. Another mother who was 29-weeks postpartum was taking sustained-release bupropion 150 mg daily. After 10.5 weeks of therapy and approximately 80% breastfeeding, serum levels of bupropion (  < 10 mcg/L) and hydroxybupropion (  < 200 mcg/L) were undetectable in her infant 3.25 hours after nursing and after the mother's dose.[6] Three breastfed infants ranging in age from 14 to 56 days whose mothers were taking bupropion 150 or 300 mg of bupropion SR had their urine collected 2 hours after a maternal dose; 1 infant had urine collected on 2 occasions. Only one of the infants' urine samples had detectable amounts (  > 10 mcg/L) of bupropion at 41 mcg/L; metabolites were not measured.[4] The mother of a 6.5-month-old had been taking escitalopram 10 mg daily since birth and had begun extended-release bupropion 150 mg daily 3 weeks earlier. Her baby was partially breastfed, receiving pumped breastmilk, formula and solid foods. At 6.5 months of age, after having been breastfed 8 hours after the mother's morning dose of bupropion, the infant was admitted to the emergency department with a seizure and vomiting. The infant's serum at this time contained a detectable, but non-quantifiable level of bupropion (  < 4.8 mcg/L) and a serum hydroxybupropion level of 11.2 mcg/L. The following morning the infant's serum hydroxybupropion level was 17.1 mcg/L.[5]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Three partially to fully breastfed infants who were 15 weeks to 14 months of age had no clinically detectable adverse effects during maternal bupropion therapy. Dosages were 100 mg 3 times daily of the immediate-release product in one mother, and 150 mg daily in the other two, one as the SR product and one as the immediate-release product.[2][6] Two women of 8 in an open-label clinical trial of bupropion SR for postpartum depression breastfed their infants. The median dosage of bupropion SR in the 8 women was 262.5 mg (range 37.5-300 mg). Seven women completed the 8-week study and 1 took the drug for 6 weeks. No specific details were given on the 2 women who breastfed their infants, but neither noted any adverse effects in their infants.[7]A woman who started taking sustained-release bupropion 150 mg daily fed her 6-month-old infant by breastfeeding and stored breastmilk in addition to solid foods. After 3 days and 2 doses of the drug, the infant had symptoms consistent with a seizure, but no infant serum levels were obtained. The seizure was possibly related to the bupropion in breastmilk.[8] An uncontrolled online survey compiled data on 930 mothers who nursed their infants while taking an antidepressant. Infant drug discontinuation symptoms (e.g., irritability, low body temperature, uncontrollable crying, eating and sleeping disorders) were reported in about 10% of infants. Mothers who took antidepressants only during breastfeeding were much less likely to notice symptoms of drug discontinuation in their infants than those who took the drug in pregnancy and lactation.[9] In a telephone follow-up study, 124 mothers who took a benzodiazepine while nursing reported whether their infants had any signs of sedation. One mother who was taking bupropion 1 mg daily, flurazepam 15 mg daily, clonazepam 0.25 mg twice daily, and risperidone 0.75 mg daily reported sedation in her breastfed infant.[10] A 6.5-month-old infant developed severe vomiting and an apparent tonic seizure after being breastfed by her mother. The mother had been taking escitalopram 10 mg daily since birth and had begun extended-release bupropion 150 mg daily 3 weeks earlier. The seizure occurred 8 hours after the mother's morning dose of bupropion. The infant's mother had noted disturbances in sleep behavior, unusual movements, and unresponsiveness followed by sleep on several previous occasions. The baby was partially breastfed, also receiving pumped breastmilk, formula, and solid foods. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the baby was discharged after being asymptomatic for 48 hours. The seizure was probably drug-related, most likely caused by bupropion and hydroxybupropion in breastmilk, but a contribution by escitalopram cannot be ruled out.[5] A retrospective database study compared women who took bupropion with no SSRI (n = 29) women who took an SSRI but no bupropion (n = 54), and women who took a combination of bupropion and a SSRI (n = 23) during breastfeeding. There were 5 (17%) adverse events reported by the mothers in their infants in the bupropion group, 4 (7%) in the SSRI group and 7 (30%) in the combination group. The proportion of adverse events was significantly higher in the combination group compared to the SSRI group. The reported adverse events included vomiting, diarrhea, jitteriness, sleepiness, hypotony and a seizure (reported in the SSRI group). No seizures were reported in infants exposed to bupropion (alone or with an SSRI) through breastfeeding There was no statistically significant difference among the groups with regards to average daily weight gain in the first 6 months after birth. therefore seizures are probably not a major concern in these infants.[11]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A 34-year-old non-pregnant woman diagnosed with depression was started on bupropion 150 mg daily. During the second week of therapy, she presented with galactorrhea and an elevated serum prolactin level of 98 mcg/L. A cranial MRI found no abnormalities. Bupropion was discontinued and the galactorrhea disappeared in 2 days. One week later, her serum prolactin level was 3 mcg/L. Fluoxetine 20 mg daily was started and continued for 4 months with no signs of galactorrhea.[11]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Infants receive citalopram in breastmilk and it is detectable in low levels in the serum of some. The dosage that the infant receives and serum level achieved are probably related to the genetic metabolic capacity of the mother and infant. A few cases of minor behavioral side effects such as drowsiness or fussiness have been reported, but no adverse effects on development have been found in infants followed for up to a year. If citalopram is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. If the mother was taking citalopram during pregnancy or if other antidepressants have been ineffective, most experts recommend against changing medications during breastfeeding. Otherwise, agents with lower excretion into breastmilk may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. The breastfed infant should be monitored for behavioral side effects such as sedation or fussiness. Mothers taking an SSRI during pregnancy and postpartum may have more difficulty breastfeeding and may need additional breastfeeding support. Breastfed infants exposed to an SSRI during the third trimester of pregnancy have a lower risk of poor neonatal adaptation than formula-fed infants."
    drug_levels: "Citalopram is metabolized to 2 metabolites, each having antidepressant activity considered to be 13% that of citalopram.[1] Maternal Levels: In a pooled analysis of serum levels from published studies and 2 unpublished cases, the authors found that 18 mothers taking an average daily dosage of 29 mg (range 20 to 60 mg) had an average milk citalopram level of 157 mcg/L (range 41 to 451 mcg/L).[1] Using the average dosage and milk level data from this paper, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated 7.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of citalopram. In 9 mothers taking citalopram 20 to 40 mg daily while breastfeeding, trough milk samples were taken immediately before nursing on the morning of day 4, and during week 2 and month 2 postpartum. Citalopram milk trough concentrations standardized to a dosage of 20 mg daily averaged 81.4, 103.4 and 75.9 mcg/L at the 3 sampling times. The authors reported that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated minimum of 0.3 and 0.2 % of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of citalopram at 2 weeks and 2 months postpartum, respectively.[2] However, these values appear to be the result of a calculation error. Using the milk concentration values above, one can calculate a minimum infant dosage of 4.7 and 3.4% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage which is consistent with values reported in other studies.In 10 breastfed (extent not stated) infants (including one pair of twins) aged 3 to 42 weeks whose mothers were taking an average daily dosage of 24 mg (range 20 to 50 mg) of citalopram, the authors calculated that their fully breastfed infants would receive an average of 5.2% (range 2.5 to 9.4%) of the maternal dosage.[3]A mother was taking oral citalopram 40 mg once daily in the evening. Single milk samples were obtained 16 hours after the dose on days 25, 46 and 53 postpartum. Milk citalopram levels were 280, 230 and 320 mcg/L. These values represent 5.8%, 4.7% and 6.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[4] Infant Levels. In a pooled analysis of 5 mother-infant pairs from published and unpublished cases, the authors found that infants had an average of 7% of their mothers' citalopram plasma levels; 1 of the 5 infants had a plasma level greater than 10% of the mother's plasma level which was defined by the authors as being elevated.[1]The breastfed infants of 9 mothers who took citalopram during pregnancy and postpartum had serum citalopram levels that were 63% of maternal serum levels at delivery. The infants' serum levels fell by 37% by day 2, 61% by day 4, and 90% by week 2, despite exclusive breastfeeding. At 2 months of age, infant citalopram serum levels were about 2% of those of the mother; metabolite serum levels were somewhat higher.[2]In 10 breastfed (extent not stated) infants aged 3 to 42 weeks whose mothers were taking citalopram in an average daily dosage of 24 mg (range 20 to 50 mg), citalopram was detected in 6 of the infants. The serum drug levels of the 10 infants averaged 0.9% (range 0 to 4.8%) of those of their mothers. Two of the infants with detectable citalopram were twins whose mother was a poor metabolizer of citalopram (CYP2C19*2 mutation). Five infants with the CYP2C19*1/*2 genotype had serum levels that were 3.75 times higher than the other 5 infants with the CYP2C19*1/*1 genotype.[3]A mother was taking oral citalopram 40 mg once daily at 11 pm. Infant serum levels were measured at 12, 25 and 53 days of age, the first at an unspecified time and the latter two at 3 pm. Infant citalopram serum levels were 2.3, 1.2 and 1.7 mcg/L at these times. The infant serum levels on days 25 and 53 represented 0.9% and 1.8% of the mothers serum levels, respectively.[4]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "The manufacturer states that drowsiness and weight loss in breastfed infants has occurred.Uneasy sleep that reversed with dosage reduction and partial formula supplementation was probably caused by citalopram in breastmilk in a 5-month-old infant.[5]A group of 10 infants breastfed (6 exclusive, 3 received some formula beginning at 2 months) from birth to one year during maternal citalopram use had normal body weight and neurological development in all infants compared to 9 control infants whose mothers did not take citalopram.[2]Three mothers who took an average citalopram dose of 15 mg once daily breastfed their infants exclusively for 4 months and at least 50% during months 5 and 6. Their infants had 6-month weight gains that were normal according to national growth standards.[6]A study compared adverse reactions in 31 infants breastfed during maternal citalopram use to a control group of 31 breastfed infants whose mothers did not take an antidepressant. There were numerically more adverse events reported in the citalopram group (3 vs 1). However, the study found no statistical difference in the rate of adverse effects between the groups of infants and none of the side effects was serious. One mother reported infant irritability and restlessness after she began citalopram at 2 months postpartum. The side effects subsided after she stopped breastfeeding 2 weeks later.[7]In 10 breastfed (extent not stated) infants aged 3 to 42 weeks whose mothers were taking citalopram an average of 24 mg daily, no short-term adverse reactions were noted clinically at the time of the study.[3]A breastfed infant whose mother took citalopram 40 mg daily throughout pregnancy and postpartum had numerous symptoms such as superficial and irregular breathing, apnea, disordered sleep and hypotonia after birth. All symptoms disappeared by 3 weeks of age. Symptoms were judged to likely be withdrawal symptoms rather than side effects of the drug in the breastmilk.[4]A woman was restarted on citalopram 10 mg daily after having stopped the drug for the last month of pregnancy. Her infant breastfed for 6 months (extent not stated). The infant had no perinatal complications, and the infant's pediatrician noted no neuropsychological abnormalities at 18 months of age.[8]A woman took citalopram 60 mg and ziprasidone 40 mg daily throughout pregnancy and postpartum. She breastfed extensively, except for occasional formula feedings by others. At 6 months of age, a pediatrician found the infant to be healthy with normal growth and development.[9] An uncontrolled online survey compiled data on 930 mothers who nursed their infants while taking an antidepressant. Infant drug discontinuation symptoms (e.g., irritability, low body temperature, uncontrollable crying, eating and sleeping disorders) were reported in about 10% of infants. Mothers who took antidepressants only during breastfeeding were much less likely to notice symptoms of drug discontinuation in their infants than those who took the drug in pregnancy and lactation.[10] A cohort of 247 infants exposed to an antidepressant in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy were assessed for poor neonatal adaptation (PNA). Of the 247 infants, 154 developed PNA. Infants who were exclusively given formula had about 3 times the risk of developing PNA as those who were exclusively or partially breastfed. Fifty-one of the infants were exposed to citalopram in utero.[11]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "The SSRI class of drugs, including citalopram, can cause increased prolactin levels and galactorrhea in nonpregnant, nonnursing patients.[12][13][14][15][16][17] In a study of cases of hyperprolactinemia and its symptoms (e.g., gynecomastia) reported to a French pharmacovigilance center, fluvoxamine was found to have a 3.9-fold increased risk of causing hyperprolactinemia compared to other drugs.[18] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In a small prospective study, 8 primiparous women who were taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI; 3 taking fluoxetine and 1 each taking citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine or sertraline) were compared to 423 mothers who were not taking an SRI. Mothers taking an SRI had an onset of milk secretory activation (lactogenesis II) that was delayed by an average of 16.7 hours compared to controls (85.8 hours postpartum in the SRI-treated mothers and 69.1 h in the untreated mothers), which doubled the risk of delayed feeding behavior in the untreated group. However, the delay in lactogenesis II may not be clinically important, since there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the percentage of mothers experiencing feeding difficulties after day 4 postpartum.[19] A case control study compared the rate of predominant breastfeeding at 2 weeks postpartum in mothers who took an SSRI antidepressant throughout pregnancy and at delivery (n = 167) or an SSRI during pregnancy only (n = 117) to a control group of mothers who took no antidepressants (n = 182). Among the two groups who had taken an SSRI, 33 took citalopram, 18 took escitalopram, 63 took fluoxetine, 2 took fluvoxamine, 78 took paroxetine, and 87 took sertraline. Among the women who took an SSRI, the breastfeeding rate at 2 weeks postpartum was 27% to 33% lower than mother who did not take antidepressants, with no statistical difference in breastfeeding rates between the SSRI-exposed groups.[20]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "The average amount of drug in breastmilk is higher with fluoxetine than with most other SSRIs and the long-acting, active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is detectable in the serum of most breastfed infants during the first 2 months postpartum and in a few thereafter. Adverse effects such as colic, fussiness, and drowsiness have been reported in some breastfed infants. Decreased infant weight gain was found in one study, but not in others. No adverse effects on development have been found in a few infants followed for up to a year.<br><br>  If fluoxetine is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. If the mother was taking fluoxetine during pregnancy or if other antidepressants have been ineffective, most experts recommend against changing medications during breastfeeding. Otherwise, agents with lower excretion into breastmilk may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. The breastfed infant should be monitored for behavioral side effects such as colic, fussiness or sedation and for adequate weight gain. Mothers taking an SSRI during pregnancy and postpartum may have more difficulty breastfeeding and may need additional breastfeeding support. Breastfed infants exposed to an SSRI during the third trimester of pregnancy have a lower risk of poor neonatal adaptation than formula-fed infants."
    drug_levels: "Fluoxetine is metabolized to norfluoxetine which has antidepressant activity that is considered to be equal to fluoxetine.[1] Maternal Levels. In a pooled analysis of serum levels from published studies and 1 unpublished case, the authors found that 20 mothers taking an average daily dosage of 28 mg (range 10 to 80 mg) had an average milk fluoxetine level of 76 mcg/L (range 23 to 189 mcg/L).[1] Using the average dosage and milk level data from this paper, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated 2.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of fluoxetine; however, the substantial contribution of norfluoxetine was not considered. In one of the studies included in the pooled analysis that measured both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in 14 mothers, the average daily infant dosage in breastmilk was about 7% (range 3 to 12%) of the mother's weight-adjusted dosage.[1]Eleven women taking fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg daily during pregnancy and lactation had trough milk fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels measured on day 4, week 2 and month 2 postpartum. When standardized to a 20 mg daily dosage, total drug concentration in breastmilk ranged from 75.4 to 91.5 mcg/L at the 3 times. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a minimum of 2.4% and 3.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of the drug and metabolite combined with this maternal dosage regimen at 2 weeks and 2 months of age, respectively.[2]In 1 mother who was 11 weeks postpartum and taking fluoxetine in a daily dosage of 20 mg, the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 3.3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[3]At 2 months postpartum, 7 mothers taking an average of 24 mg of fluoxetine daily had average breastmilk levels of 63.7 mcg/L of fluoxetine and 103.8 mcg/L of norfluoxetine. These data indicate that a fully breastfed infant would receive 25 mcg/kg daily of fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine. This value would be about 6.3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[4]Twenty-three nursing mothers who were taking fluoxetine in an average dose of 21 mg daily for a minimum of 4 weeks and averaging 3.7 months postpartum had random foremilk samples (n = 30) analyzed for R- and S-isomers of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. The weight-adjusted dosages of these infants (average 91% breastfed) were calculated to be 0.54% and 0.57% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage for fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, respectively. The concentrations of the active S-isomer in milk were about 1.9 times that of the R- isomer.[5] Data from 24 women on the excretion of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine into milk from two previously published studies[6][7] were combined and reanalyzed using NONMEM. Data from the two original papers were previously included in a pooled analysis reported above.[1] Simulations of the data indicated that a fully breastfed infant would receive a median of 0.017 mg/kg daily of fluoxetine plus norfluoxetine. This resulted in a median weight-adjusted percentage of 5.9% of the maternal dosage, with a 99th percentile value of 23%.[8] Infant Levels: In a pooled analysis of 22 mother-infant pairs from published and unpublished cases, the authors found that infants had an average of 7% (range 0 to 59%) of their mothers' fluoxetine plasma levels; 4 of the 22 infants (18%) had a plasma level greater than 10% of the mothers' which was defined by the authors as being elevated.[1] Eleven breastfed (6 exclusively; 5 supplemented) infants with an average age of 24.6 weeks (range 5 to 36 weeks) whose mothers were taking an average of 27.3 mg daily of fluoxetine all had measurable norfluoxetine serum levels averaging 3.2 mcg/L (range 1.4 to 8.7 mcg/L) which was 3.2% of average maternal norfluoxetine serum levels. One infant also had a detectable fluoxetine level of 2.6 mcg/L.[9] The breastfed (extent not stated) infants of 11 women taking fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg daily during pregnancy and lactation had trough milk fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels measured on day 4, week 2 and month 2 postpartum. At 2 weeks of age, fluoxetine was detectable in the serum of 2 of the infants in concentrations of 7.1% of the average maternal serum level. Norfluoxetine was detectable in the serum of all infants in average concentrations of 38% of the average maternal serum level. At 2 months of age, no infant had detectable fluoxetine levels; norfluoxetine was detectable in the serum of all infants in concentrations averaging 6.5% of the average maternal serum level.[2] At 2 months postpartum, the breastfed infants of 7 mothers taking an average of 24 mg of fluoxetine daily had an average serum levels of 2 mcg/L of fluoxetine and 8.5 mcg/L of norfluoxetine which was about 9% of the maternal serum norfluoxetine level.[4]Thirty serum levels were obtained from 23 infants with an average age of 3.7 months and breastfed an average of 91% by mothers who had been taking fluoxetine in an average dose of 21 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Six of 7 infants had detectable serum levels in the first month, 6 of 8 in the second month and 2 of 14 thereafter. The ratio of infant to maternal serum levels of fluoxetine plus S-norfluoxetine dropped rapidly during the first month and was less than 10% by 2 months of age. Infant serum levels of S-fluoxetine and S-norfluoxetine were about 3 times as high as the R-isomers during the first 2 months. Only norfluoxetine could be detected after this time and the S- to R-isomer ratio fell to about 1.4.[5]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Colic, decreased sleep, vomiting and watery stools occurred in a 6-day-old breastfed infant probably caused by maternal fluoxetine.[10] Two other reports of colic in breastfed infants, a 1.76-month-old and a 2-month-old, were possibly caused by fluoxetine in breastmilk. The older of the two also exhibited hyperactivity.[7]Another case of possible increased irritability in a 3-month-old was noted by one pediatrician observer; however, the mother and another pediatrician disagreed.[11]Occurrence of hyperglycemia and glycosuria in a 5-month-old, possibly from fluoxetine in breastmilk was reported to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee.[12]A 3-day-old breastfed infant was difficult to arouse, ceased rooting behavior, decreased nursing, and was moaning and grunting. Although the infant had been exposed in utero and was somewhat drowsy during the first 2 days of life, symptoms became worse after the mother's milk came in on day 3. These effects were probably caused by fluoxetine in breastmilk.[13] Possible drug-induced seizure-like activity and cyanosis occurred in a breastfed 3-week-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking fluoxetine, carbamazepine and buspirone during pregnancy and breastfeeding.[14] One observational report of 4 infants found no apparent neurological abnormalities following exposure to fluoxetine in milk for 12 to 52 weeks.[15]A retrospective, case-control, cohort study compared the weights of the infants of mothers who took fluoxetine during pregnancy and breastfed for at least 2 weeks postpartum to the infants of mothers who took fluoxetine during pregnancy and did not breastfeed. Compared to controls, decreased weight gain occurred among the 26 infants exposed postpartum to fluoxetine in breastmilk, although the weights were still in the normal range.[16]A prospective study of 51 nursing women taking fluoxetine and 63 nursing women who took no fluoxetine found no effect on weight gain, but reported a greater frequency of unspecified side effects in the infants of mothers who took fluoxetine.[17] This study's results have been reported only in abstract form, so some details are lacking.In a prospective study of 40 women who took fluoxetine throughout pregnancy, 21 breastfed their infants (extent and duration not stated). Testing of the infants at 15 to 71 months of age found no differences in cognitive, language or temperament measurements between infants who were breastfed and those who were not.[18]In a study comparing the 31 infants of depressed mothers who took an SSRI during pregnancy for major depression with 13 infants of depressed mothers who did not take an SSRI, mental development and most motor development in both groups was normal at follow-up averaging 12.9 months. Three of the treated mothers took fluoxetine in doses averaging 23.3 mg daily for an average of 3 months while breastfeeding their infants. Psychomotor development was slightly delayed compared to controls, but the contribution of breastfeeding to abnormal development could not be determined.[19]Platelet serotonin levels were measured in 11 mothers and their breastfed infants after 4 to 12 weeks of fluoxetine therapy. Maternal dosages ranged from 20 to 40 mg daily. Ten of the infants were under 6 months of age and 4 were under 3 months of age at the start of therapy; 6 were exclusively breastfed. Although maternal platelet serotonin levels were decreased from 157 mcg/L to 23 mcg/L by fluoxetine therapy, average infant serotonin levels were 217 mcg/L before and 230 mcg/L after maternal therapy. These findings indicate that the amount of fluoxetine ingested by the infants was not sufficient to affect serotonin transport in platelets in most breastfed infants. However, 3 infants experienced drops in platelet serotonin of 13, 24 and 60%, respectively. The latter infant was the only one with measurable fluoxetine plasma levels as well as norfluoxetine, but had no discernible adverse effects. One other infant had a delay in motor development at 24 weeks, but had normal mental development; 6 other infants were within 1 standard deviation of normal in both measures when tested between 24 and 56 weeks of age. Platelets and neurons both have the same serotonin transporter, so this effect on platelet serotonin might indicate potential effects on the nervous system of some breastfed infants.[9]Twenty-nine mothers who took fluoxetine in an average dosage of 34.6 mg daily for depression or anxiety starting no later than 4 weeks postpartum, breastfed their infants exclusively for 4 months and at least 50% during months 5 and 6. Their infants had 6-month weight gains that were normal according to national growth standards and mothers reported no abnormal effects in their infants.[20]One study of side effects of SSRI antidepressants in nursing mothers found no adverse reactions that required medical attention in one infant whose mother was taking fluoxetine. No specific information on maternal fluoxetine dosage, extent of breastfeeding or infant age was reported.[21]Eleven infants who were breastfed (extent and duration not stated) during maternal use of fluoxetine for depression (n = 5) or panic disorder (n = 6) had normal weight gain at 12 months of age that was not significantly different from a control group of infants whose mothers took no psychotropic medications. Neurologic development was also normal at 12 months of age.[2] In 1 breastfed (extent not stated) infant aged 11 weeks whose mother was taking fluoxetine 20 mg daily, no adverse reactions were noted clinically at the time of the study.[3] A small study compared the reaction to pain in infants of depressed mothers who had taken an SSRI during pregnancy alone or during pregnancy and nursing to a control group of unexposed infant of nondepressed mothers. Infants exposed to an SSRI either prenatally alone or prenatally and postnatally via breastmilk had blunted responses to pain compared to control infants. Seven of the 30 infants were exposed to fluoxetine. Because there was no control group of depressed, nonmedicated mothers, an effect due to maternal behavior caused by depression could not be ruled out. The authors stressed that these findings did not warrant avoiding drug treatment of depression during pregnancy or avoiding breastfeeding during SSRI treatment.[4] An infant was born to a mother taking fluoxetine 40 mg daily, oxycodone 20 mg 3 times daily, and quetiapine 400 mg daily. The infant was breastfed 6 to 7 times daily and was receiving 120 mcg of oral morphine 3 times daily for opiate withdrawal. Upon examination at 3 months of age, the infant's weight was at the 25th percentile for age, having been at the 50th percentile at birth. The authors attributed the weight loss to opiate withdrawal. The infant's Denver developmental score was equal to his chronological age.[22] An uncontrolled online survey compiled data on 930 mothers who nursed their infants while taking an antidepressant. Infant drug discontinuation symptoms (e.g., irritability, low body temperature, uncontrollable crying, eating and sleeping disorders) were reported in about 10% of infants. Mothers who took antidepressants only during breastfeeding were much less likely to notice symptoms of drug discontinuation in their infants than those who took the drug in pregnancy and lactation.[23] A cohort of 247 infants exposed to an antidepressant in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy were assessed for poor neonatal adaptation (PNA). Of the 247 infants, 154 developed PNA. Infants who were exclusively given formula had about 3 times the risk of developing PNA as those who were exclusively or partially breastfed. Fifteen of the infants were exposed to fluoxetine in utero.[24] A late preterm infant was born to a mother who took fluoxetine 60 mg daily throughout pregnancy and during exclusive breastfeeding. At 7 days of age, the infant was found to be having jerking movements, with hypertonia and hyperreflexia as well as tachypnea and compensated metabolic acidosis. The infant's Finnegan scores were the range of 7 to 10. On day 8 of life, the infant had a serum fluoxetine level of 120 mcg/L, which is similar to therapeutic adult levels. Breastfeeding was discontinued and after 5 days of formula feeding the infant's Finnegan scores had decreased to a range of 3 to 6. After 10 days of formula, most symptoms had subsided. At 3 months of age, the infant was growing and developing normally. The infant's symptoms were attributed to serotonin syndrome caused by the high levels of fluoxetine rather than to withdrawal.[25] Breastfeeding might have contributed to maintaining the high fluoxetine levels after birth."
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Fluoxetine has caused increased prolactin levels and galactorrhea in nonpregnant, nonnursing patients.[26][27][28][29] In a study of cases of hyperprolactinemia and its symptoms (e.g., gynecomastia) reported to a French pharmacovigilance center, fluoxetine was found to have a 3.6-fold increased risk of causing hyperprolactinemia compared to other drugs.[30] Preliminary animal and in vitro studies found that fluoxetine may have some estrogenic activity.[31] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In a small prospective study, 8 primiparous women who were taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI; 3 taking fluoxetine and 1 each taking citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine or sertraline) were compared to 423 mothers who were not taking an SRI.

One infant was reported to have an elevated serum level of fluvoxamine, but most who have been tested have undetectable serum levels. No adverse effects on breastfed infants have been reported, including a limited amount of long-term follow-up on growth and development.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: In a pooled analysis of serum levels from published studies and 1 unpublished case, the authors found that 6 mothers taking an average daily dosage of 159 mg (range 50 to 300 mg) had an average milk fluvoxamine level of 174 mcg/L (range 18 to 478 mcg/L).[1] Using the average dosage and milk level data from this paper, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated 0.98% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of fluvoxamine. Two mothers breastfeeding while taking stable doses of fluvoxamine were studied with timed blood and milk samples over 24 hours. The first patient, who was taking 150 mg daily and nursing a 26-month-old, had a peak milk level of 425 mcg/L at 2.1 hours after the dose. The second patient, who was taking 50 mg daily and nursing a 3-week-old, had a peak milk level of 67 mcg/L at 4.2 hours after the dose. The authors estimated the absolute infant dosages to be 38.4 and 5.4 mcg/kg daily in the two infants, respectively, or an average 1.38% and 0.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[2] Infant Levels: Four exclusively breastfed infants aged 6 to 13 weeks had undetectable (  < 1 mcg/L) fluvoxamine serum levels during maternal therapy with fluvoxamine in dosages of 100 to 150 mg daily.[3] In a pooled analysis of 3 mother-infant pairs from published and unpublished cases, the authors found that breastfed infants had an average of 16% (range 0 to 45%) of their mothers' fluvoxamine plasma levels; 1 of the 3 infants had a plasma level greater than 10% of the mother's which was defined by the authors as being elevated.[1] Serum levels of fluvoxamine were undetectable (  < 2 mcg/L) in a partially breastfed 26-month-old during maternal intake of 150 mg daily. Fluvoxamine was also undetectable in the serum of an exclusively breastfed 3-week-old during maternal intake of 50 mg daily.[2]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "One infant whose mother began taking fluvoxamine 100 mg daily 17 weeks postpartum was breastfed from birth to 5 months of age. The medical and nursing staff did not note any adverse effect in the infant during the 10 weeks of observation during maternal hospitalization. The infant had normal Bayley developmental scores at age 4 months and 21 months.[5] No adverse effects were found in 2 infants, a partially breastfed 26-month-old during maternal intake of 150 mg daily, who also had a normal Denver Developmental Score, and an exclusively breastfed 3-week-old during maternal intake of 50 mg daily.[2] Three mothers who took an average fluvoxamine dose of 117 mg once daily breastfed their infants exclusively for 4 months and at least 50% during months 5 and 6. Their infants had 6-month weight gains that were normal according to national growth standards and the mothers reported no abnormal effects in their infants.[6] One study of the side effects of SSRI antidepressants in nursing mothers found no adverse reactions that required medical attention in one infant whose mother was taking fluvoxamine. No specific information on maternal fluvoxamine dosage, extent of breastfeeding or infant age was reported.[7] A woman who was treated chronically with quetiapine 400 mg and fluvoxamine 200 mg daily took the drugs throughout pregnancy and postpartum. She partially breastfed her infant (extent not stated) for 3 months from birth. No adverse events were seen in the infant who developed normally.[8] A cohort of 247 infants exposed to an antidepressant in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy were assessed for poor neonatal adaptation (PNA). Of the 247 infants, 154 developed PNA. Infants who were exclusively given formula had about 3 times the risk of developing PNA as those who were exclusively or partially breastfed. Four of the infants were exposed to low doses of fluvoxamine in utero and none had PNA.[9] A 5-month-old infant developed severe diarrhea (15 times daily), mild vomiting (2 to 3 times daily), agitation and decreased sleep within 2 days after maternal initiation of fluvoxamine 50 mg daily. Symptoms resolved within 24 hours after the mother discontinued the drug, and recurred a week later after fluvoxamine was restarted in the mother. Other causes of the gastrointestinal symptoms could not be found. Fluvoxamine was probably the cause of the reaction. The authors speculate that the infant might have abnormal metabolism of the drug that resulted in high serum concentrations.[10]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Fluvoxamine has caused increased prolactin levels and galactorrhea in nonpregnant, nonnursing patients.[11][12][13] In one case, euprolactinemic gynecomastia and galactorrhea occurred in a 19-year-old man who was also taking risperidone.[14] In a study of cases of hyperprolactinemia and its symptoms (e.g., gynecomastia) reported to a French pharmacovigilance center, fluvoxamine was found to have a 4.5-fold increased risk of causing hyperprolactinemia compared to other drugs.[15] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In a small prospective study, 8 primiparous women who were taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI; 3 taking fluoxetine and 1 each taking citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine or sertraline) were compared to 423 mothers who were not taking an SRI. Mothers taking an SRI had an onset of milk secretory activation (lactogenesis II) that was delayed by an average of 16.7 hours compared to controls (85.8 hours postpartum in the SRI-treated mothers and 69.1 h in the untreated mothers), which doubled the risk of delayed feeding behavior in the untreated group. However, the delay in lactogenesis II may not be clinically important, since there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the percentage of mothers experiencing feeding difficulties after day 4 postpartum.[16] A case control study compared the rate of predominant breastfeeding at 2 weeks postpartum in mothers who took an SSRI antidepressant throughout pregnancy and at delivery (n = 167) or an SSRI during pregnancy only (n = 117) to a control group of mothers who took no antidepressants (n = 182). Among the two groups who had taken an SSRI, 33 took citalopram, 18 took escitalopram, 63 took fluoxetine, 2 took fluvoxamine, 78 took paroxetine, and 87 took sertraline. Among the women who took an SSRI, the breastfeeding rate at 2 weeks postpartum was 27% to 33% lower than mother who did not take antidepressants, with no statistical difference in breastfeeding rates between the SSRI-exposed groups.[17]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited information indicates that maternal doses of up to 120 mg daily produce low levels in milk and would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants, especially if the infant is older than 2 months. If mirtazapine is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. Exclusively breastfed infants should be monitored for behavioral side effects and adequate growth if this drug is used during lactation."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A woman who was 14 weeks postpartum was started on mirtazapine 30 mg daily. After reaching steady-state (therapy duration not specified), a foremilk level of 7 mcg/L and hindmilk level of 18 mcg/L were measured 22 hours after the previous dose. The next day, a foremilk level of 28 mcg/L and hindmilk level of 34 mcg/L were measured 15 hours after the previous dose.[1] Eight nursing mothers who averaged 6.3 months postpartum (range 1.5 to 13 months) were taking mirtazapine in an average dosage of 495 mcg/kg daily (30 to 120 mg daily). Mothers provided milk samples every 3 to 4 hours for 24 hours after their daily dose. Using these data, the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 8 mcg/kg daily of mirtazapine and 3 mcg/kg daily of desmethylmirtazapine. These values averaged 1.5% (range 0.6 to 2.8%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage for mirtazapine and 0.4% (range 0.1 to 0.7%) for desmethylmirtazapine. Mirtazapine's concentration in hindmilk averaged 2.3 times the foremilk concentration in 4 of the subjects tested. Desmethylmirtazapine's concentration in hindmilk was only 10% higher than in foremilk.[2] A woman who was 6 weeks postpartum was taking mirtazapine 22.5 mg daily at night. Foremilk and hind milk levels of mirtazapine were 130 and 145 mcg/L, respectively, at 4 hours after the dose and 61 and 90 mcg/L at 10 hours after the dose.[3] A woman took mirtazapine 15 to 30 mg daily throughout the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Her postpartum dose was 15 mg daily or 224 mcg/kg daily. In the morning, 12 hours after the dose, the concentration of mirtazapine in her foremilk was 15 mcg/L.[4] Infant Levels. A woman who was 14 weeks postpartum was started on mirtazapine 30 mg daily. The patient breastfed her 6.8 kg infant 6 times daily during therapy and an infant plasma level of 0.2 mcg/L was found 15 hours after a dose, which was 0.8% of the maternal serum concentration.[1] Eight infants who averaged 6.3 months of age (range 1.5 to 13 months) were breastfed (extent not stated) by mothers taking mirtazapine in an average dosage of 495 mcg/kg daily for 6 to 129 days. No mirtazapine or desmethylmirtazapine were detected (  < 1 mcg/L) in the serum of 4 infants whose mothers' doses ranged from 309 to 517 mcg/kg daily. Three others had unquantifiably low levels in milk. One infant, whose mother was taking 1967 mcg/kg daily, had 1.5 mcg/L of mirtazapine in serum, but an unquantifiable serum level of the metabolite.[2] A 6-week-old infant was exclusively breastfed by a mother who was taking mirtazapine 22.5 mg at daily at night. Mirtazapine was undetectable in the infant's plasma 12.5 hours after the dose.[3] A 2-month-old infant was breastfed (extent not stated) by a mother who was taking mirtazapine 15 mg (224 mcg/kg) daily at night. The infant's serum mirtazapine concentration at 2 hours after the first morning feeding (14 hours after the previous maternal dose) was 10 mcg/L compared to a maternal serum mirtazapine concentration of 27 mcg/L at 12 hours after the previous dose.[4]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A 14-week old infant was breastfed 6 times daily during maternal treatment with mirtazapine 30 mg daily. After 6 weeks of therapy, the infant was judged to have normal psychomotor development and no adverse effects, including sedation or abnormal weight gain.[1] Eight infants who averaged 6.3 months of age (range 1.5 to 13 months) were breastfed by mothers taking mirtazapine in an average dosage of 495 mcg/kg daily for 6 to 129 days. At the time they were studied, the average Denver developmental age in the 7 infants studied averaged 101% of normal. No adverse effects were noted in any of the infants.[2] A 6-week-old infant was exclusively breastfed by a mother who was taking mirtazapine 22.5 mg at daily at night beginning at 4 weeks postpartum. Weekly follow-ups of the infant found no sedation or alterations in weight gain, although the infant's weight was consistently below the 25th percentile even before mirtazapine was begun.[3] A 2-month-old infant was breastfed (extent not stated) by a mother taking 15 mg of mirtazapine daily during pregnancy and lactation. The mother stated that the infant had a higher birthweight and gained weight more rapidly than her previous 3 infants, and that unlike her other infants, this infant slept through the night at this age. The authors noted that these observations cannot necessarily be attributed to mirtazapine.[4] In a case series of 55 women who took mirtazapine during pregnancy and postpartum, 24 of their 56 infants were exclusively breastfed and 20 were partially breastfed. Of the infants who were exposed in utero during the third trimester, those who were breastfed either partially or exclusively had a lower frequency of poor neonatal adaptation syndrome than those who were exclusively formula fed. No sleeping or feeding problems were seen in any of the infants.[5]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Gynecomastia, hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea were reported in an 89-year-old man after 21 months of therapy with mirtazapine 30 mg daily. Symptoms regressed 1 month after discontinuation and prolactin levels normalized.[6] A 28-year-old female inpatient developed galactorrhea, mastodynia, fatigue, and extended subcutaneous edema of the trunk and extremities 4 weeks after adjusting her mirtazapine dose to 30 mg daily. At this time her morning serum prolactin level was not elevated; however, 12 days later, morning serum prolactin was 32.1 mcg/L (normal range 4.79-23.3 mcg/L). Serum prolactin normalized, and edema and galactorrhea remitted within 1 week after discontinuing mirtazapine and starting escitalopram. Pituitary tumor was ruled out. Mirtazapine was probably the cause of the patient's symptoms.[7] The clinical relevance of these findings in nursing mothers is not known. The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited information indicates that usual doses of nefazodone produce low but variable levels in milk that would not be expected to cause adverse effects in a breastfed infant, especially if the infant is older than 2 months. However, adverse effects in a breastfed preterm infant have been reported. If nefazodone is required by the mother of an older infant, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but until more data become available, other drugs may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant."
    drug_levels: "Nefazodone is metabolized to 4 metabolites, but only hydroxynefazodone is thought to be active as an antidepressant. Its antidepressant activity is considered to be equal to that of nefazodone.[1] Maternal Levels: The trough milk levels of nefazodone and its metabolites were measured 10 to 15 hours after the previous dose in 3 women who had been taking nefazodone for at least 3 weeks. Dosages were 200 mg twice daily, 50 mg twice daily, and for the third, 50 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening. Milk nefazodone levels were 57, 687, and 213 mcg/L, respectively; milk hydroxynefazodone was not quantifiable (  < 50 mcg/L) in the first 2 mothers and 104 mcg/L in the third.[2] Using the trough milk level data, the estimated minimum intake of these infants would be 0.24, 6.2 and 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of nefazodone and its active metabolite. In another paper by the same authors, it appears that 2 of the above mothers were studied again in more detail. One mother who was 21 weeks postpartum had been taking nefazodone 50 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening for 6 days. The other mother who was 4 weeks postpartum had been taking nefazodone 200 mg twice daily for 7 months. Four or 5 milk levels were analyzed for drug and metabolites, but values do not appear in the published paper. No metabolites appeared in the milk of the first mother; only nefazodone and hydroxynefazodone were found in the milk of the second mother. The authors estimated that the first infant would receive 0.28 mg/kg daily or 0.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and the second would receive 0.54 mg/kg daily or 2.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[3] A woman was taking nefazodone 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening. The highest milk levels of nefazodone occurred 1 to 3 hours after the morning dose, with the highest level of 358 mcg/L occurring 3 hours after the dose. Hydroxynefazodone levels were consistently much lower with a peak level of 32 mcg/L at 2 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.34% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of nefazodone and its active metabolite with this maternal dosage regimen. Two inactive metabolites would contribute an additional 0.11% of maternal dosage.[4] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Drowsiness, lethargy, poor feeding and low body temperature occurred in a 2.1 kg breastfed 9-week-old infant who was born preterm at 27 weeks to a mother taking a dose of 300 mg of nefazodone daily. The symptoms were probably caused by nefazodone in breastmilk.[4]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Because of the low levels of paroxetine in breastmilk, amounts ingested by the infant are small and paroxetine has not been detected in the serum of most infants tested. Occasional mild side effects have been reported, especially in the infants of mothers who took paroxetine during the third trimester of pregnancy, but the contribution of the drug in breastmilk is not clear. Most authoritative reviewers consider paroxetine one of the preferred antidepressants during breastfeeding.[1][2][3][4][5] Mothers taking an SSRI during pregnancy and postpartum may have more difficulty breastfeeding and may need additional breastfeeding support. Breastfed infants exposed to an SSRI during the third trimester of pregnancy have a lower risk of poor neonatal adaptation than formula-fed infants."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: In a pooled analysis of serum levels from published studies and 3 unpublished cases, the authors found 50 mothers taking an average daily dosage of 21 mg (range 10 to 50 mg) had an average milk paroxetine level of 28 mcg/L (range 0 to 153 mcg/L).[1] Using the average dosage and milk level data from this paper, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated 1.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of paroxetine. From data in 6 mothers taking paroxetine in an average daily dosage of 20 mg (range 10 to 30 mg), the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 1.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[6] At 2 months postpartum, 19 mothers taking an average of 25 mg of paroxetine daily had average milk levels of 13.5 mcg/L at random times after the previous dose. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.02 mg/kg of paroxetine daily.[7] A woman had taken paroxetine 15 mg daily during pregnancy. She did not receive a dose in the 22.75 hours before delivery or on the day of delivery. She resumed paroxetine 15 mg daily 24 hours postpartum. At 3.75 hours after the third postpartum dose, her breastmilk paroxetine level was 371 mcg/L.[8] Four nursing mothers who were 6.5 to 18.5 weeks postpartum were taking paroxetine in doses of 12.5 to 60 mg daily in addition to quetiapine for major depression postpartum. Breastmilk samples obtained at various times after the dose had undetectable (  < 9.9 mcg/L) levels of paroxetine in 3 mothers. One mother who was taking 50 mg daily had a milk paroxetine level of 255 mcg/L.[9] Infant Levels: Sixteen breastfed infants (2 about 50% breastfed; the others 95% or more breastfed) aged 6 to 13 weeks had undetectable (  < 1 mcg/L) paroxetine serum levels during maternal therapy with paroxetine in an average daily dosage of 18.75 mg (range 5 to 30 mg).[10] In a pooled analysis of 40 mother-infant pairs from published and unpublished cases, the authors found that no infants had measurable paroxetine plasma levels.[1] In 6 breastfed (extent not stated) infants aged 2 to 33 weeks whose mothers were taking paroxetine in an average daily dosage of 20 mg (range 10 to 30 mg), paroxetine was undetectable (  < 1.6 mcg/L) in all of the infants' serum. One mother taking 20 mg daily and her infant were both poor metabolizers (homozygous for CYP2D6*4), yet no paroxetine was detectable in infant serum.[6] At 2 months postpartum, the breastfed infants of 19 mothers taking an average of 25 mg of paroxetine daily had an average serum paroxetine level of 0.95 mcg/L which was 5% of the maternal serum level.[7]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Agitation and difficulty feeding in one infant (age and other details not reported) that were possibly related to paroxetine in breastmilk were reported to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee.[11] In a controlled cohort study of mothers who took paroxetine during pregnancy (diagnoses not reported), 36 mothers took paroxetine during the third trimester and breastfed their infants. Of these, 8 reported side effects in their infants including alertness (6), constipation (3), sleepiness (1), and irritability (1). There were no reports of side effects in the control group of mothers who breastfed and did not use paroxetine in the third trimester or during nursing. The relative contribution of transplacental and breastmilk acquisition of the drug could not be determined.[12] In a study comparing the infants of mothers who took an SSRI during pregnancy for major depression with the infants of depressed mothers who did not take an SSRI, mental development and most motor development was normal at follow-up averaging 12.9 months in both groups. Four of the treated mothers took paroxetine in doses averaging 28.6 mg daily for an average of 7.8 months while breastfeeding (extent not stated) their infants. Psychomotor development was slightly delayed compared to controls, but the contribution of breastfeeding to abnormal development could not be determined.[13] A prospective cohort study evaluated 27 infants whose mothers took paroxetine (diagnoses not reported) at an average dose of 20.7 mg daily for at least 2 weeks during breastfeeding (extent not stated). Two control groups consisted of two groups of mothers who neither breastfed nor took an SSRI. All but 7 of the 27 mothers took paroxetine during some part of pregnancy. Weight at 3 months was less in the paroxetine group, but multivariate analysis indicated that maternal paroxetine use was not the determining factor. Weights at 6 and 12 months were not different from the control groups and other developmental milestones were reached at the normal times. One of the paroxetine-exposed infants (age not stated) was reported by the mother to be irritable.[14] Fifteen mothers who took an average paroxetine dosage of 20.4 mg daily for depression or anxiety starting no later than 4 weeks postpartum, breastfed their infants exclusively for 4 months and at least 50% during months 5 and 6. Their infants had 6-month weight gains that were normal according to national growth standards and mothers reported no abnormal effects in their infants.[15] In 6 breastfed (extent not stated) infants aged 2 to 33 weeks whose mothers were taking paroxetine 10 to 30 mg daily, no adverse reactions were noted clinically at the time of the study.[6] An infant born to a mother taking paroxetine had serum paroxetine levels about one-third that of the mother's at birth. The infant was a genetic poor metabolizer which apparently was the cause of the high serum levels. Although the infant had symptoms attributed to paroxetine obtained in utero, the mother continued taking paroxetine 30 mg daily and breastfeeding (extent not stated). At 4 months of age, the infant had gained weight normally and had no evidence of neurological side effects.[16]An 18-month-old infant with a 2-week history of vomiting was found to have hypokalemia, hypochloremic alkalosis and mild dehydration. The infant had been admitted twice previously 2 and 3 months before with a similar picture. Serum renin and aldosterone were normal. The infant's mother had been taking paroxetine 40 mg daily for about 1 year for depression and breastfeeding the infant (extent not stated). Paroxetine was detected, but not quantified, in the mother's breastmilk and infant's serum. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the infant was thriving 6 weeks later with a normal metabolic profile. The authors attributed the infant's metabolic abnormalities to paroxetine-induced syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.[17] The reaction was possibly caused by paroxetine in breastmilk, but strong evidence was lacking and other possible causes cannot be ruled out. A small study compared the reaction to pain in infants of depressed mothers who had taken an SSRI during pregnancy alone or during pregnancy and nursing, to a control group of unexposed infants of nondepressed mothers. Infants exposed to an SSRI either prenatally alone or prenatally and postnatally via breastmilk had blunted responses to pain compared to control infants. Nineteen of the 30 infants were exposed to paroxetine. Because there was no control group of depressed, nonmedicated mothers, an effect due to maternal behavior caused by depression could not be ruled out. The authors stressed that these findings did not warrant avoiding drug treatment of depression during pregnancy or avoiding breastfeeding during SSRI treatment.[7] One study of side effects of SSRI antidepressants in nursing mothers found no adverse reactions that required medical attention among 3 infants whose mother was taking paroxetine. No specific information on maternal paroxetine dosage, extent of breastfeeding or infant age was reported.[18]A nursing mother with bipolar disorder began taking 20 mg of paroxetine at 4 months postpartum and was then started on quetiapine 200 mg twice daily at 6 months postpartum. She breastfed regularly (extent not stated) and no obvious adverse effects were noted in the infant.[19] Four nursing mothers who were 6.5 to 18.5 weeks postpartum were taking paroxetine in doses of 12.5 to 60 mg daily in addition to quetiapine for major depression postpartum. Their breastfed infants' development were tested at 9 to 18 months of age with the Bayley Scales. Measurements were slightly low on the mental and psychomotor development scale in one infant and on the mental development scale in another; both infants had undetectable (  < 9.9 mcg/L) serum paroxetine levels. All other infants had scores that were within normal limits. The authors concluded that the low scores of the two infants were probably not caused by the drugs received by the infants in breastmilk.[9] An uncontrolled online survey compiled data on 930 mothers who nursed their infants while taking an antidepressant. Infant drug discontinuation symptoms (e.g., irritability, low body temperature, uncontrollable crying, eating and sleeping disorders) were reported in about 10% of infants. Mothers who took antidepressants only during breastfeeding were much less likely to notice symptoms of drug discontinuation in their infants than those who took the drug in pregnancy and lactation.[20] A cohort of 247 infants exposed to an antidepressant in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy were assessed for poor neonatal adaptation (PNA). Of the 247 infants, 154 developed PNA. Infants who were exclusively given formula had about 3 times the risk of developing PNA as those who were exclusively or partially breastfed. Forty-nine of the infants were exposed toparoxetine in utero.[21]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Paroxetine can cause galactorrhea, usually with increased prolactin levels, in nonpregnant, nonnursing patients.[22][23][24][25][26][27][28] In a study of cases of hyperprolactinemia and its symptoms (e.g., gynecomastia) reported to a French pharmacovigilance center, paroxetine was found to have a 3.1-fold increased risk of causing hyperprolactinemia compared to other drugs.[29] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In a small prospective study, 8 primiparous women who were taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI; 3 taking fluoxetine and 1 each taking citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine or sertraline) were compared to 423 mothers who were not taking an SRI. Mothers taking an SRI had an onset of milk secretory activation (lactogenesis II) that was delayed by an average of 16.7 hours compared to controls (85.8 hours postpartum in the SRI-treated mothers and 69.1 h in the untreated mothers), which doubled the risk of delayed feeding behavior in the untreated group. However, the delay in lactogenesis II may not be clinically important, since there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the percentage of mothers experiencing feeding difficulties after day 4 postpartum.[30] A case control study compared the rate of predominant breastfeeding at 2 weeks postpartum in mothers who took an SSRI antidepressant throughout pregnancy and at delivery (n = 167) or an SSRI during pregnancy only (n = 117) to a control group of mothers who took no antidepressants (n = 182). Among the two groups who had taken an SSRI, 33 took citalopram, 18 took escitalopram, 63 took fluoxetine, 2 took fluovoxamine, 78 took paroxetine, and 87 took sertraline. Among the women who took an SSRI, the breastfeeding rate at 2 weeks postpartum was 27% to 33% lower than mother who did not take antidepressants, with no statistical difference in breastfeeding rates between the SSRI-exposed groups.[31]"

Rarely, preterm infants with impaired metabolic activity might accumulate the drug and demonstrate symptoms similar to neonatal abstinence. Most authoritative reviewers consider sertraline one of the preferred antidepressants during breastfeeding.[1][2][3][4][5] Mothers taking an SSRI during pregnancy and postpartum may have more difficulty breastfeeding and may need additional breastfeeding support.

    drug_levels: "Sertraline is metabolized to norsertraline (desmethylsertraline) that has antidepressant activity considered to be about 10% that of sertraline.[1] Maternal Levels: In a pooled analysis of serum levels from published studies and 4 unpublished cases, the authors found that 15 mothers taking an average daily dosage of 83 mg (range 25 to 200 mg) had an average breastmilk sertraline level of 45 mcg/L (range 7 to 207 mcg/L).[1] Using the average dosage and milk level data from this paper, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated 0.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of sertraline. Twenty-six women who were an average of 15.8 weeks postpartum (range 5 to 36 weeks) and receiving an average of 124 mg sertraline daily for at least 14 days for severe depression were studied while breastfeeding with extensive milk and serum sampling over a 24-hour period. All milk samples had detectable sertraline (average 129 mcg/L; range 11 to 938 mcg/L) and norsertraline (average 258 mcg/L; range 20 to 1498 mcg/L). Drug concentrations were higher in the hindmilk than the foremilk. Analysis of milk sertraline data from 15 mothers who submitted complete sets of milk samples indicated that the peak concentration of the drug and metabolite occurred 8 to 9 hours after a dose. In these women, the concentration in milk correlated with serum concentration, but not daily dosage. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 0.54% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and that pumping and discarding milk 8 to 9 hours after the mother's dose would decrease the infant's daily dosage by 17%.[6]From data in 6 mothers who were 5 to 34 weeks postpartum and taking sertraline in an average daily dosage of 64 mg (range 50 to 100 mg), the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[7] At 2 months postpartum, 4 mothers taking an average of 87.5 mg of sertraline daily had average milk levels of 26.4 mcg/L of sertraline and 29 mcg/L of norsertraline at random times after the previous dose. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.04 mg/kg of sertraline daily.[8] The mother of a preterm infant was taking sertraline 150 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. Her breastmilk levels of sertraline and norsertraline on 3 days at random times averaged 201 and 358 mcg/L, respectively.[9] Infant Levels: Of 30 breastfed infants (19 exclusively, 11 breastfed 50% or more) aged 6 to 13 weeks, 22 had undetectable (  < 1 mcg/L) sertraline serum levels during maternal therapy with sertraline dosages of 25 to 200 mg daily. Of the 8 infants who had detectable serum levels, their average sertraline serum level was 7.9 mcg/L. Their mothers, who were taking an average of 109 mg daily, had an average serum level of 52.8 mcg/L.[10] In a pooled analysis of 53 mother-infant pairs from published and unpublished cases, the authors found that infants had an average of 2% (range 0 to 15%) of the sertraline plasma levels of the mothers'; 3 of the infants had a plasma level greater than 10% of the mothers' which was defined by the authors as being elevated.[1] Twenty-two breastfed (20 exclusively) infants with an average age of 16.6 weeks (range 4 to 28 weeks) whose mothers were receiving an average of 124 mg sertraline daily for at least 14 days for severe depression were studied. Infant serum levels were measured 2.2 hours (range 0.5 to 5 hours) after nursing. Four infants had detectable sertraline (  > 2 mcg/L) and 11 infants had detectable norsertraline in their serum with an average concentration of 22 mcg/L. One 11-week-old infant who was being treated for acute asthma with albuterol, inhaled corticosteroids and hydroxyzine had serum levels higher than its mother's, even though 4 other infants received higher doses of sertraline and norsertraline through milk.[6] In 6 breastfed (extent not stated) infants aged 5 to 34 weeks whose mothers were taking sertraline in an average daily dosage of 15 mg (range 5 to 34 mg), sertraline and norsertraline were undetectable (  < 3.4 mcg/L).[7]In a study of mothers given sertraline prophylactically for recurrent postpartum depression, 7 opted to breastfeed. Infant serum was tested at 4 weeks of age with a maternal dosage of 50 mg daily. Sertraline (  < 2 mcg/L) and norsertraline (  < 12 mcg/L) were undetectable in the serum of any infant.[11] In a study comparing sertraline to nortriptyline for postpartum depression, 13 infants were breastfed by mothers taking sertraline (dosage and extent of nursing were not stated). After a constant maternal sertraline dosage for at least 14 days, infants had their serum concentrations measured. The infants were an average of 5.9 weeks old at the time of serum sampling. Sertraline was not detectable (  < 2 mcg/L) in any of the infants' serum; norsertraline serum levels ranged from undetectable (  < 2 mcg/L) to 6 mcg/L.[12] At 2 months postpartum, the breastfed infants of 4 mothers taking an average of 87.5 mg of sertraline daily had undetectable (  < 0.1 mcg/L) serum levels of sertraline and norsertraline.[8] A 33-week preterm infant was exclusively breastfed by a mother who was taking sertraline 150 mg daily during gestation, at delivery and postpartum. Because of symptoms similar to neonatal abstinence syndrome, the infant's serum concentrations of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were measured on day 5 postpartum. Levels were 13 and 52 mcg/L, respectively. Because of ongoing symptoms, breastfeeding was stopped on day 9 and the infant's serum levels reportedly dropped, although specific values were not presented in the paper. The infant was later found to have genetically intermediate metabolism of two of the CYP450 enzymes involved in sertraline metabolism.[9] Authors of a metaanalysis on sertraline reported infant serum levels of sertraline and norsertraline in 25 infants who were breastfed by mothers taking sertraline. Ten of the infants were exclusively breastfed, two were 80% breastfed and the breastfeeding status of the others was not reported. Only two infants, both exclusively breastfed, had detectable serum sertraline levels of 2.1 and 2.4 mcg/L. The other infants had undetectable (  < 2 mcg/L) sertraline levels. Four other infants had detectable norsertraline levels ranging from 2.6 to 4.7 mcg/L. Sampling times were not reported.[3]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Two side effects possibly related to sertraline in breastmilk have been reported to the Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus occurred in one 4-month-old infant[13] and agitation that spontaneously resolved was reported in another infant.[14] None of 26 infants with an average age of 16.6 weeks (range 4 to 28 weeks) whose mothers were receiving an average of 124 mg sertraline daily had any detectable acute adverse reactions to sertraline in breastmilk. All had been breastfeeding for at least 3 weeks.[6] Whole blood serotonin levels were measured in 14 mothers and their breastfed infants after 6 to 16 weeks of sertraline therapy. Maternal dosages ranged from 25 to 200 mg daily. Although maternal serotonin levels were decreased from 159 mcg/L to 19 mcg/L by sertraline therapy, infant serotonin levels averaged 227 mcg/L before and 224 mcg/L after maternal therapy. The authors concluded that these findings indicate that the amount of sertraline ingested by the infants was not sufficient to affect platelet serotonin uptake in breastfed infants. Platelets and neurons both have the same serotonin transporter, so this lack of effect was seen as indirect evidence of safety of sertraline use during breastfeeding. None of the infants experienced any adverse effects from sertraline in breastmilk, including 6 exclusively breastfed infants under 3 months of age.[15] Twenty-five mothers who took an average sertraline dosage of 82.4 mg daily breastfed their infants exclusively for 4 months and breastfed at least 50% during months 5 and 6. Their infants had 6-month weight gains that were normal according to national growth standards and the mothers reported no abnormal effects in their infants.[16] In 6 infants aged 5 to 34 weeks whose mothers were taking sertraline 50 to 100 mg daily, no adverse reactions were noted clinically at the time of the study.[7] No adverse effects were seen in 7 infants who were 4 weeks old and whose mothers had been taking sertraline 50 mg daily since day 4 postpartum.[11] One study of side effects of SSRI antidepressants in nursing mothers found no adverse reactions that required medical attention among 2 infants whose mother was taking sertraline. No specific information on maternal sertraline dosage, extent of breastfeeding or infant age was reported.[17] A small study compared the reaction to pain in infants of depressed mothers who had taken an SSRI during pregnancy alone or during pregnancy and nursing, to a control group of unexposed infants of nondepressed mothers. Infants exposed to an SSRI either prenatally alone or prenatally and postnatally via breastmilk had blunted responses to pain compared to control infants. Four of the 30 infants were exposed to sertraline. Because there was no control group of depressed, nonmedicated mothers, an effect due to maternal behavior caused by depression could not be ruled out. The authors stressed that these findings did not warrant avoiding drug treatment of depression during pregnancy or avoiding breastfeeding during SSRI treatment.[8] An uncontrolled online survey compiled data on 930 mothers who nursed their infants while taking an antidepressant. Infant drug discontinuation symptoms (e.g., irritability, low body temperature, uncontrollable crying, eating and sleeping disorders) were reported in about 10% of infants. Mothers who took antidepressants only during breastfeeding were much less likely to notice symptoms of drug discontinuation in their infants than those who took the drug in pregnancy and lactation.[18] In a telephone follow-up study, 124 mothers who took a benzodiazepine while nursing reported whether their infants had any signs of sedation. One mother who was taking sertraline 50 mg daily, zopiclone 2.5 mg about every 3 days as needed, and also took alprazolam 0.25 mg on 2 occasions, reported sedation in her breastfed infant.[19]A mother was taking sertraline 150 mg daily during gestation, at delivery and postpartum while exclusively breastfeeding her infant. Her preterm infant born by cesarean section at 33 weeks gestation developed hyperthermia, muscle tone regulation disorders, and high-pitched crying during the first 24 hours after birth. The symptoms worsened on the 4th day of life, but breastfeeding was continued. On day 5, the infant had serum concentrations of sertraline and its metabolite that are in the reported therapeutic range in adults. Breastfeeding was discontinued on day 9 postpartum and the infant's symptoms dissipated, serum drug levels decreased and the infant thrived over several months. The infant was later found to have genetically intermediate metabolism of two of the CYP450 enzymes involved in sertraline metabolism. The authors attributed the infant's symptoms to serotonergic overstimulation caused by persistently high sertraline levels from breastfeeding and reduced metabolism.[9] The reaction was probably caused by sertraline. An infant was being breastfed (extent not stated) by a mother who began taking sertraline 50 mg daily and  methylphenidate after 5 weeks postpartum. Dosage was started at 10 mg daily with an immediate-release product and gradually increased to 72 mg daily of an extended-release product. At 14 weeks of age, the infant was developing normally no feeding difficulties. Examinations at 6 months and 1 year of age found no developmental problems in the child.[20] In a study of sertraline for postpartum depression, 11 women completed the full 7-week duration of the study out of 36 who were entered. Six mothers reported breastfeeding their infants (extent not stated) and 5 did not breastfeed their infants. The average sertraline dose at week 7 was 100 mg daily. No side effects were reported for any of the infants in the sertraline or placebo groups at this time.[21] Authors of a metaanalysis on sertraline reported 25 infants who were breastfed by mothers taking sertraline. Ten of the infants were exclusively breastfed, two were 80% breastfed and the breastfeeding status of the others was not reported. No adverse reactions occurred.[3] A cohort of 247 infants exposed to an antidepressant in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy were assessed for poor neonatal adaptation (PNA). Of the 247 infants, 154 developed PNA. Infants who were exclusively given formula had about 3 times the risk of developing PNA as those who were exclusively or partially breastfed. Sixty-eight of the infants were exposed to sertraline in utero.[22]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Sertraline has caused galactorrhea in nonpregnant, nonnursing patients.[23][24][25] However, in a study of cases of hyperprolactinemia and its symptoms (e.g., gynecomastia) reported to a French pharmacovigilance center, sertraline was not found to have an increased risk of causing hyperprolactinemia compared to other drugs.[26] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. A midwife observed 6 patients who reported a decrease in milk supply after starting sertraline (dosages not reported). One of the mothers had been taking sertraline since the 6th month of pregnancy. She reported an increase in milk supply when she stopped sertraline for one week at 4 months postpartum. When she restarted sertraline, her milk supply reportedly decreased. In all of the women, the milk supply increased in 2 to 3 days after increasing fluid and the frequency of nursing.[27] In a small prospective study, 8 primiparous women who were taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI; 3 taking fluoxetine and 1 each taking citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine or sertraline) were compared to 423 mothers who were not taking an SRI. Mothers taking an SRI had an onset of milk secretory activation (lactogenesis II) that was delayed by an average of 16.7 hours compared to controls (85.8 hours postpartum in the SRI-treated mothers and 69.1 h in the untreated mothers), which doubled the risk of delayed feeding behavior in the untreated group. However, the delay in lactogenesis II may not be clinically important, since there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the percentage of mothers experiencing feeding difficulties after day 4 postpartum.[28]A case control study compared the rate of predominant breastfeeding at 2 weeks postpartum in mothers who took an SSRI antidepressant throughout pregnancy and at delivery (n = 167) or an SSRI during pregnancy only (n = 117) to a control group of mothers who took no antidepressants (n = 182). Among the two groups who had taken an SSRI, 33 took citalopram, 18 took escitalopram, 63 took fluoxetine, 2 took fluvoxamine, 78 took paroxetine, and 87 took sertraline. Among the women who took an SSRI, the breastfeeding rate at 2 weeks postpartum was 27% to 33% lower than mother who did not take antidepressants, with no statistical difference in breastfeeding rates between the SSRI-exposed groups.[29]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Infants receive venlafaxine and its active metabolite in breastmilk, and the metabolite of the drug can be found in the plasma of most breastfed infants, but no proven drug-related side effects have been reported. Breastfed infants, especially newborn or preterm infants, should be monitored for excessive sedation and adequate weight gain if this drug is used during lactation, possibly including measurement of serum levels of desvenlafaxine [O-desmethylvenlafaxine], to rule out toxicity if there is a concern. However, newborn infants of mothers who took the drug during pregnancy may experience poor neonatal adaptation syndrome as seen with other antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs. Use of venlafaxine during breastfeeding has been proposed as a method of mitigating infant venlafaxine withdrawal symptoms,[1] but only one apparently successful case of this use has been reported."
    drug_levels: "Venlafaxine is metabolized to a metabolite, desvenlafaxine, that has antidepressant activity similar to that of venlafaxine.[2] Maternal Levels. Three mothers with infants aged 0.37, 1.3 and 6 months were taking venlafaxine in doses of 3.04 to 8.18 mg/kg daily for at least a week. Peak breastmilk levels of venlafaxine and its active metabolite, desvenlafaxine, occurred 1 to 3 hours after the dose in 2 of the mothers. Infants received an average of 7.6% (range 4.7 to 9.2%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of venlafaxine plus desvenlafaxine.[3] Six women averaging 7 months postpartum were receiving venlafaxine 225 to 300 mg daily for at least 18 days; 1 was taking the sustained-release (SR) formulation once daily and the others took 2 divided doses daily. In the women taking immediate-release product, the time of the peak milk levels averaged 2 hours (range 1.7 to 2.8 hours) for venlafaxine and 2.8 hours (range 1.8 to 4.2 hours) for desvenlafaxine. For the SR formulation, peak venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine levels occurred at 5.7 and 7.7 hours, respectively. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 6.4% (range 5.2 to 7.4%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of venlafaxine as the drug plus metabolite.[4] Three women were taking venlafaxine during breastfeeding in doses of 37.5, 75 and 225 mg daily. Milk samples were taken 8 hours after a dose and measured for venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine. The infants were estimated to have received 11.8%, 3% and 6.3% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage.[5] In 3 women 8 to 30 weeks postpartum who were taking venlafaxine 75 to 225 mg daily, the authors calculated that their fully breastfed infants would receive an average of 5.2% of the maternal dosage, primarily as desvenlafaxine.[6] A woman who was taking venlafaxine 375 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum had a combined breastmilk level of 690 mcg/L of venlafaxine and 2 metabolites. The authors estimated that the breastfed infant was receiving at least 3.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[1] Two women who were 6.5 and 9.5 weeks postpartum and taking venlafaxine 75 mg and 225 mg daily had their milk measured at unreported times after their doses. The venlafaxine concentrations in their milk were 103 and 327 mcg/L, respectively.[7] Eleven women taking an average of 194 mg of venlafaxine daily (1 as immediate-release and 10 as sustained-release) had their breastmilk venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine concentrations measured. The estimated excretion of the drug and metabolite into breastmilk was 8.1% (range 3.2 to 13.3%) of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage. The peak drug concentration in breastmilk occurred at about 8 hours after the dose; desvenlafaxine was the primary contributor to total milk concentration. The estimated infant dosage was 0.208 mg/kg daily (range 0.07 to 0.38 mg/kg daily),[8] which translates to 6.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage Infant Levels: Three breastfed (extent not stated) infants aged 0.37, 1.3 and 6 months whose mothers were taking venlafaxine 3.04 to 8.18 mg/kg daily had undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) venlafaxine and an average of 100 mcg/L (range 23 to 225 mcg/L) of desvenlafaxine in their plasma.[3] Two mothers on stable doses of venlafaxine 75 and 150 mg daily exclusively breastfed their infants for 6 months. At ages 3 and 4 weeks, respectively, venlafaxine was undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) in the serum of both infants. Desvenlafaxine was detectable in their serum at 16 and 21 mcg/L, respectively.[9] Three breastfed (extent not stated) infants whose mothers were taking venlafaxine 37.5, 75 and 225 mg daily had blood samples taken 8 hours after the previous maternal dose. The infants, whose ages were 3, 10.4 and 14.6 weeks, had venlafaxine serum levels of 9 mcg/L,   < 3 mcg/L and undetectable; desvenlafaxine serum levels were   < 8, 7.5 and 12.5 mcg/L, respectively.[5] Of 7 breastfed (extent not stated) infants with an average age of 7 months, including 1 set of twins, whose mothers were taking 225 to 300 mg of venlafaxine daily, only 1 (maternal dose 225 mg daily) had a measurable serum level of venlafaxine of 5 mcg/L (detection limit 1 mcg/L). Measurable desvenlafaxine serum levels were 3, 6, 20 and 38 mcg/L in 4 of the 7 infants.[4] In 3 breastfed (extent not stated) infants aged 8 to 30 weeks whose mothers were taking venlafaxine 75 to 225 mg daily, their serum drug levels were 10.2% of those of their mothers, mostly as desvenlafaxine.[6]Six nursing infants (average 20 weeks; range 7.3 to 60 weeks of age) whose mothers were taking an average of 206 mg daily of venlafaxine had their serum analyzed for venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine. Five were exclusively breastfed and 1 was about 50% breastfed. Five of the 6 had no detectable (  < 2 mcg/L) venlafaxine in their serum, and 1 had a concentration of 5 mcg/L. Two infants, including the one who was partially breastfed had no detectable desvenlafaxine in their serum; the other 4 had desvenlafaxine concentrations ranging from 4 to 243 mcg/L. The group of infants had an average serum concentrations of the drug and metabolite of 37% that of their mothers' serum.[8]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "No acute adverse effects or abnormal weight gain were seen in 3 breastfed infants who had detectable serum levels of desvenlafaxine.[3] No adverse effects on growth or in sleep, feeding or behavioral patterns were noticed clinically in 2 infants who were exclusively breastfed for 6 months during maternal therapy with venlafaxine 75 and 150 mg daily.[9] Three mothers took an average venlafaxine dose of 162.5 mg once daily. They breastfed their infants exclusively for 4 months and at least 50% during months 5 and 6. Their infants had 6-month weight gains that were normal according to national growth standards.[10] Seven infants (including 1 set of twins) breastfed for 2.7 to 10.3 months during maternal venlafaxine therapy. Three mothers were taking venlafaxine since birth and 3 were started later. Denver Developmental Screening Tests in all infants were normal. All but 2 had normal growth; these 2 had a decrease in weight gain.[4] In 3 infants aged 8 to 30 weeks whose mothers were taking venlafaxine 75 to 225 mg daily, no adverse reactions were noted clinically at the time of the study.[6] An newborn infant whose mother had been taking venlafaxine 375 mg daily during pregnancy had symptoms of lethargy, poor sucking ability, and dehydration at 2 days of age. The infant was allowed to breastfeed and the symptoms subsided over 1 week. The authors concluded that the symptoms were likely withdrawal symptoms that were mitigated by the venlafaxine in breastmilk.[1] Two nursing mothers were taking venlafaxine and quetiapine for postpartum depression; one was also taking trazodone. Their breastfed infants' development were tested at 12 to13 months of age with the Bayley Scales. Scores were within normal limits on the mental, psychomotor and behavior scales.[11] Thirteen infants whose mothers were taking venlafaxine in doses ranging from 37.5 to 300 mg daily were breastfed (11 exclusively and 2 about 50%). Three of the infants were also exposed to a second psychotropic drug in breastmilk: 1 each of buspirone, trazodone, quetiapine. None of the infants had any adverse reactions reported by their mothers or in their medical records.[8] Two nursing mothers who were 6.5 and 9.5 weeks postpartum were taking venlafaxine in doses of 75 and 225 mg daily, respectively, in addition to quetiapine for major depression postpartum; one mother was also taking trazodone. Their breastfed infants' development were tested at 9 to 18 months of age with the Bayley Scales. Both infants had scores that were within normal limits.[7] A mother was taking venlafaxine 75 mg daily for depression and anxiety, although when the drug was started is not clear from the report. Her 1-month-old infant was seen in a pediatric clinic and was demonstrating agitation, infantile colic, drowsiness, increased startle response, jitteriness and sleeplessness. The symptoms began at 1 week of age and became progressively worse over time and with breastfeeding. The symptoms were possibly caused by venlafaxine, although whether they represent a withdrawal reaction of direct drug effects cannot be determined.[12]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "One mother who was nursing a 10.3-month-old infant reported that her milk letdown took longer after starting venlafaxine 1 month earlier.[4] Cases of galactorrhea and elevated serum prolactin have been reported in which venlafaxine played a primary or secondary role in the etiology.[11][13][14][15][16][17][18] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Acetaminophen is a good choice for analgesia, and fever reduction in nursing mothers. Amounts in milk are much less than doses usually given to infants. Adverse effects in breastfed infants appear to be rare."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A single oral dose of 650 mg of acetaminophen was given to 12 nursing mothers who were 2 to 22 months postpartum. Peak milk levels of 10 to 15 mg/L occurred between 1 and 2 hours after the dose in all patients. Acetaminophen was undetectable (  < 0.5 mg/L) in all mothers 12 hours after the dose. The authors calculated that an infant who ingested 90 mL of breastmilk every 3 hours would receive an average of 0.88 mg of acetaminophen or 0.14% (range 0.04 to 0.23%) of the mother's absolute dosage.[1] Using data from this study, an infant would receive a maximum of about 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.Three women took a single 500 mg dose of acetaminophen. Peak milk levels averaging 4.2 mg/L occurred within 2 hours after the dose.[2] Using data from this study, an infant would receive a maximum of about 3.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Four women who were 2 to 8 months postpartum were given a single 1 gram dose of acetaminophen. Peak milk levels occurred between 1 and 2.5 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that a breastfed infant would receive an average of 1.1% and a maximum of 1.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. This dose is about 0.5% of the lowest recommended infant dose of acetaminophen.[3] Infant Levels: No acetaminophen was detected in the urine of 12 breastfed infants aged 2 to 22 months after maternal ingestion of 650 mg of acetaminophen.[1]Urine was collected for 1 to 3.5 hours after nursing in 6 infants aged 2 to 6 days whose mothers received 1 to 2 grams of acetaminophen 2 to 4 hours before nursing their infant. Infants excreted an average of 401 mcg of acetaminophen and its metabolites in urine during the collection interval. These neonates excreted a greater percentage of drug as acetaminophen and much less as the sulfate metabolite than adults.[3]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A maculopapular rash on the upper trunk and face of a 2-month-old infant was probably caused by acetaminophen in breastmilk. The rash occurred after 2 days of therapy in the mother at a dose of 1 gram at bedtime. It subsided when the drug was discontinued and recurred 2 weeks later after another acetaminophen dose of 1 gram was taken by the mother.[4] Two papers report 14 women who breastfed after taking acetaminophen or its prodrug phenacetin with no adverse effects to their infants.[1][5] In a telephone follow-up study, mothers reported  no side effects among 43 infants exposed to acetaminophen in breastmilk.[6] Two clinicians speculated that breastmilk exposure to acetaminophen during breastfeeding might be a risk factor for asthma and wheezing in the breastfed infants based on their personal observations.[7] However, these observations were uncontrolled and cannot be considered to be valid proof of an association.[8]"

Topical acyclovir applied to small areas of the mother's body away from the breast should pose no risk to the infant. Only water-miscible cream or gel products should be applied to the breast because ointments may expose the infant to high levels of mineral paraffins via licking.[1]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A 4-month-postpartum women was taking 200 mg orally 5 times daily every 4 hours while awake. After 4 days of therapy, milk samples were taken 9 hours after the previous dose and at 4 times after a 200 mg dose. The lowest milk level of 427 mcg/L occurred 30 minutes after the first dose. At 3.2  hours after the dose, the milk acyclovir level was 1.3 mg/L and apparently still increasing.[2] A woman who was 1 year postpartum was taking acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times daily. Milk levels taken immediately before a dose during 5 days of therapy ranged from 0.78 to 1.07 mg/L. Samples taken after the last dose decreased with a half-life of 2.8 hours.[3] A woman who had taken oral acyclovir 400 mg 3 times daily for 3 days in the peripartum period had a breastmilk acyclovir level of 54 mcg/L 5 days after her last dose of acyclovir.[4] A mother nursing her 7-month-old infant took acyclovir 800 mg orally 5 times a day. Three milk acyclovir levels on days 5 and 6 of therapy ranged from 4.2 to 5.8 mg/L, with the highest level 9.4 hours after the previous dose. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive 0.73 mg/kg/day of acyclovir at this maternal dosage or about 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[5] A woman who was 6 weeks postpartum received intravenous acyclovir 300 mg (5 mg/kg) 3 times daily for 5 days. Milk samples were taken every 6 hours after the last dose. The peak level was 7.3 mg/L and the drug was detectable in milk for up to 88 hours after the last dose.[6] Using the level 6 hours after the last dose, a fully breastfed infant would receive 1.1 mg/kg/day with this maternal dosage regimen.Acyclovir is given to neonates in intravenous dosages of 20 to30 mg/kg daily. Dosages received in breastmilk with high maternal doses are only about 3 to 5% of this dose. Because the infant receives breastmilk doses orally and acyclovir is only about 20% orally bioavailable,[5] the systemic dosage that the nursing infant receives is 1% or less of a typical infant dosage. Infant Levels: A 4-month-old infant whose mother was taking 200 mg orally 5 times was breastfed just before a dose.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Aspirin is best avoided during breastfeeding; however, some expert opinion indicates that low-dose (75 to 162 mg daily) aspirin may be considered as an antiplatelet drug for use in breastfeeding women.[1][2] If low-dose aspirin is taken, avoiding breastfeeding for 1 to 2 hours after a dose might minimize the risks of antiplatelet effects in the infant.<br><br>  After aspirin ingestion, salicylic acid is excreted into breastmilk, with higher doses resulting in disproportionately higher milk levels. Long-term, high-dose maternal aspirin ingestion probably caused metabolic acidosis in one breastfed infant. Reye's syndrome is associated with aspirin administration to infants with viral infections, but the risk of Reye's syndrome from salicylate in breastmilk is unknown. An alternate drug is preferred over continuous high-dose, aspirin therapy."
    drug_levels: "Aspirin is rapidly metabolized to salicylate after ingestion, so most studies have measured salicylate levels in breastmilk after aspirin administration to the mother; however, some studies have not measured salicylate metabolites in breastmilk that may be hydrolyzed in the infant's gut and absorbed as salicylate.[3] Maternal Levels: A woman taking aspirin 4 grams daily for rheumatoid arthritis was nursing her 5 kg infant (age not reported). Salicylate was not detectable (  <  50 mg/L) in breastmilk with the relative insensitive assay used.[4] Six nursing mothers who were 2 to 8 months postpartum (average 5 months) were given aspirin doses of 500, 1000 and 1500 mg of aspirin orally on 3 separate occasions. Peak breastmilk salicylate levels were 5.8 mg/L, 15.8 mg/L, and 38.8 mg/L, respectively. The time of the peak levels occurred between 2 and 6 hours after ingestion, with little variation in levels over time. The disproportionate increase in milk levels as the dose increased was attributed to nonlinear metabolism and protein binding.[5] Milk and blood levels of the salicylate metabolites of aspirin were determined in 8 lactating women following oral administration of 1 g of aspirin. Peak salicylic acid milk levels averaging 2.4 mg/L occurred 3 hours after the dose. Milk contents of salicyluric acid were greater than those of salicylic acid; a mean peak level of 10.2 mg/L was reached after 9 hours, and averaged 4.4 mg/L 24 hours after the dose. Total salicylate and metabolite levels were 5.1 mg/L at 3 hours, 9.9 mg/L at 6 hours, 11.2 mg/L at 9 hours and 10.2 mg/L at 12 hours after the dose. Acid labile conjugates were less than 0.2 mg/L.[6] Using an average salicylate plus salicylurate level over the first 12 hours, a fully breastfed infant would receive an average of 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Two women given aspirin 454 mg orally had peak salicylate milk levels of about 1 mg/L 1 hour after the dose. The authors estimated that about 0.1% of the mothers' total dose would appear in breastmilk in 48 hours.[7] However, salicylate metabolites were not measured in milk. A woman who was breastfeeding a 4-month-old was taking long-term aspirin therapy in dosages ranging from 2 to 5.9 g daily. During this therapy, milk was obtained 4 hours after a 650 mg dose and just before taking a dose of 975 mg. The trough milk salicylate level was 2 mg/L and a peak level of 10 mg/L occurred 3 hours after the dose. Salicylate levels ranged from 4 to 7 mg/L over the 5 hours after the peak.[8] Using the peak level from this study, a fully breastfed infant would receive about 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of salicylate. The assay method used should have measured both salicylate and metabolites in milk. Infant Levels: A 9-week-old infant who was born at 36 weeks gestation was receiving about 50% breastmilk and 50% formula. The infant's mother was taking 2.4 g of aspirin daily and the infant's serum contained 65 mg/L of salicylate.[9]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A 16-day-old breastfed infant developed metabolic acidosis with a salicylate serum level of 240 mg/L and salicylate metabolites in the urine. The mother was taking 3.9 g/day of aspirin for arthritis, and salicylate in breastmilk probably caused the infant's illness, but the possibility of direct administration to the infant could not be ruled out.[10] Thrombocytopenia, fever, anorexia and petechiae occurred in a 5-month-old breastfed infant 5 days after her mother started taking aspirin for fever. One week after recovery, the infant was given a single dose of aspirin 125 mg and the platelet count dropped once again. The original symptoms were probably caused by salicylate in breastmilk.[11] Hemolysis after aspirin and phenacetin taken by the mother of a 23-day-old, G-6-PD-deficient infant was possibly due to aspirin in breastmilk.[12] In a telephone follow-up study, mothers reported no side effects among 15  infants exposed to aspirin (dose and infant age unspecified) in breastmilk.[13]"

Alfentanil is highly protein bound which should result in less transfer to breastmilk than other opiates; however, because there is no published experience with repeated doses of intravenous alfentanil during established lactation, other agents may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of alfentanil to a few days with careful monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately. Labor pain medication may delay the onset of lactation."

Colostrum was sampled prior to surgery at 4 and 28 hours after the last intraoperative dose. No postoperative doses were given. At 4 hours after the last dose, the average level of alfentanil in colostrum was 0.88 mcg/L and the highest measured level was 1.5 mcg/L. Alfentanil milk levels 28 hours after the last dose were about the same as presurgery (control) levels; however, average cumulative alfentanil dosage was not reported.[1] Using the highest measured alfentanil level in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an alfentanil dosage of 0.2 mcg/kg daily.

Categories of medication were spinal or epidural only, spinal or epidural plus another medication, and other pain medication only. Women who received medications from any of the categories had about twice the risk of having delayed lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) compared to women who received no labor pain medication.[4]"

Two hours after a dose her breastmilk contained 0.9 mg/L of allopurinol and 53.7 mg/L of its active metabolite oxypurinol. Four hours after the dose, her breastmilk contained 1.4 mg/L of allopurinol and 48 mg/L of oxypurinol. The authors calculated that the exclusively breastfed infant would receive between 0.14 and 0.2 mg/kg of allopurinol and between 7.2 to 8 mg/kg of oxypurinol daily. This dose of oxypurinol is slightly less than the infant allopurinol dose of 10 mg/kg daily.[2][3] Infant Levels:  A 5-week-old infant whose mother had been taking allopurinol 300 mg daily for 4 weeks had plasma levels of allopurinol that was undetectable (  < 0.5 mg/L) and of oxypurinol that was 6.6 mg/L 2 hours after nursing and 4 hours after the mother's dose of allopurinol.

Eleven breastmilk samples were obtained over the 36 hours after the dose. A mean peak alprazolam milk level of 3.7 mcg/L occurred at an average of 1.1 hours (range 0.47 to 3.8 hours) after the dose. The half-life of alprazolam in milk averaged 14.5 hours. The metabolites 4-hydroxyalprazolam and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam were not detected (  < 0.5 to 1 mcg/L) in milk.

    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Increased infant irritability following discontinuation of breastfeeding occurred in a 1-week-old infant whose mother had taken alprazolam during pregnancy and continued to take it after delivery. This reaction probably indicates that there was sufficient alprazolam in breastmilk to prevent withdrawal. The authors reported correspondence with the manufacturer who stated that they had received reports of infant withdrawal symptoms (crying, irritability and sleep disturbances) for 2 weeks in a 9-month-old exclusively breastfed infant after slow (over 3 weeks) maternal discontinuation of alprazolam (dosage unspecified).[2] In one telephone follow-up study of 5 infants (ages not stated) exposed to alprazolam during breastfeeding, 1 mother reported drowsiness in her infant. The reaction did not require medical attention.[3] In a telephone follow-up study, 124 mothers who took a benzodiazepine while nursing reported whether their infants had any signs of sedation. About 5% of mothers were taking alprazolam. One mother who was taking sertraline 50 mg daily, zopiclone 2.5 mg about every 3 days as needed, and also took alprazolam 0.25 mg on 2 occasions, reported sedation in her breastfed infant.[4]"

After slow discontinuation of alprazolam and institution of quetiapine and fluvoxamine, galactorrhea ceased after about one month, menses normalized after about 2 months, and serum prolactin decreased to a normal level.[7] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

Monitor the infant for possible effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash). Unconfirmed epidemiologic evidence indicates that the risk of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in infants might be increased by maternal use of macrolide antibiotics during breastfeeding."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A woman who was 1 day postpartum was given 1 g of azithromycin orally. Forty-eight hours later her milk azithromycin was 0.64 mg/L. An oral regimen of 500 mg daily for 5 days was started and more milk samples were obtained. One hour after the first dose, breastmilk contained 1.3 mg/L and 30 hours after the third dose milk contained 2.8 mg/L.[1] Because of the slow clearance and accumulation of azithromycin, it is difficult to interpret these milk levels. The dose that the infant would receive in milk would gradually increase for several days because maternal blood levels would increase until steady-state had been reached. If the level of 2.8 mg/L is used as an approximate trough level, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a minimum of 0.42 mg/kg daily compared to the dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg daily used in infants of 6 months and over. In a study of 30 women given azithromycin 500 mg intravenously 15, 30 or 60 minutes prior to incision for cesarean section, 8 women extracted breastmilk by pump. Breastmilk (colostrum) samples were obtained between 12 and 48 hours after the dose. Azithromycin persisted in breastmilk up to 48 hours after a dose with a median breastmilk concentration of 1713 mcg/L at a median of 30.7 hours after the dose. A computer model was constructed and the calculated median half-life in breastmilk was 15.6 hours, which was longer than the maternal serum half-life of 6.7 hours. Using the model, the authors calculated that with continuous administration of 500 mg every 12 hours, steady-state would occur in 3 days and an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.1 mg/kg daily.[2] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A cohort study of infants diagnosed with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis found that affected infants were 2.3 to 3 times more likely to have a mother taking a macrolide antibiotic during the 90 days after delivery. Stratification of the infants found the odds ratio to be 10 for female infants and 2 for male infants. All of the mothers of affected infants nursed their infants. Most of the macrolide prescriptions were for erythromycin, but only 7% were for azithromycin. However, the authors did not state which macrolide was taken by the mothers of the affected infants.[3] A retrospective database study in Denmark of 15 years of data found a 3.5-fold increased risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in the infants of mothers who took a macrolide during the first 13 days postpartum, but not with later exposure. The proportion of infants who were breastfed was not known, but probably high. The proportion of women who took each macrolide was also not reported.[4] A study comparing the breastfed infants of mothers taking amoxicillin to those taking a macrolide antibiotic found no instances of pyloric stenosis. However, most of the infants exposed to a macrolide in breastmilk  were exposed to roxithromycin. Only 10 of the 55 infants exposed to a macrolide were exposed to azithromycin. Adverse reactions occurred in 12.7% of the infants exposed to macrolides which was similar to the rate in amoxicillin-exposed infants. Reactions included  rash, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and somnolence.[5] Eight women who were given azithromycin 500 mg intravenously 15, 30 or 60 minutes prior to incision for cesarean section breastfed their newborn infants.

    drug_levels: "Buprenorphine has poor oral bioavailability and is usually given by the sublingual or parenteral route. Sublingual bioavailability is 30 to 40% in adults and peak levels in blood occur 60 to 90 minutes after a dose. Buprenorphine is metabolized to the active metabolite, norbuprenorphine. Further metabolism is by glucuronidation. Maternal Levels: A breastfeeding mother taking oral buprenorphine maintenance 4 mg daily during pregnancy and lactation had milk samples collected 6 times over the course of a day at 4 weeks postpartum. Milk levels and milk volumes ingested by the infant were measured, but not reported. The authors estimated that the total dose ingested by the infant over 1 day was 3.28 mcg of buprenorphine and 0.33 mcg of norbuprenophine.[8] Assuming an infant weight of 4 kg, the infant dosage in this study is equivalent to about 1.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Four mothers who were 4 days postpartum and taking 0.4, 2, 4 or 6 mg of oral buprenorphine maintenance once daily during pregnancy and lactation had their milk collected 2, 4, 6 and 12 hours after a dose. Peak milk levels occurred 2 hours after the dose in the mothers taking 2 and 4 mg and 4 hours after the dose in the mother taking 6 mg daily. Peak levels were 0.8, 7.8 and 5.8 mcg/L, respectively. Milk levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were undetectable (lower limit of the assay not given) in the mother taking buprenorphine 0.4 mg daily. Average milk levels in the mothers taking 2, 4 and 6 mg were 0.4, 3.5, and 4.4 mcg/L of buprenorphine and 0.57, 0.45, and 1.15 mcg/L of norbuprenorphine, respectively.[9][10] Based on the average milk levels reported, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive less than 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Dosages were on the low end of the usual dosage range for treatment of opiate withdrawal. Furthermore, the authors reported that the mothers' doses were given orally. The oral route is known to have poor bioavailability. The combination of low dose and oral route may have contributed to the low milk levels.One woman who was receiving daily buprenorphine (dosage and route not stated) for narcotic abstinence had milk levels of 520, 720 and 230 mcg/L on days 3, 6 and 9 postpartum (time of sample not stated).[11] One woman who was 8 days postpartum had been receiving buprenorphine 8 mg sublingually for narcotic abstinence for 7 months. Ten random milk samples were collected over 4 days. The highest milk levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were 14.7 and 6.3 mcg/L.[12] Using the peak milk level data, the estimated maximum intake of an exclusively breastfed infant would be 2.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, but not including the contribution of any glucuronide metabolite. Six women receiving a median daily dose of 0.29 mg/kg of buprenorphine for opiate abstinence were studied during the first 5 to 8 days postpartum. Hindmilk samples were obtained 6 to 8 times over a 24-hour period. Breastmilk contained estimated median infant doses of 0.42 mcg/kg of buprenorphine and 0.33 mcg/kg of norbuprenorphine daily, which are equivalent to 0.2% and 0.12% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. The range of buprenorphine plus norbuprenorphine was 0.18% to 0.77% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Milk from the nursing mother of a 9-month-old infant receiving 0.32 mg/kg of buprenorphine had concentrations of the drug and metabolite similar to those of the other women.[13] Seven infant who averaged 1.12 months postpartum (range 0.58 to 1.85 months) and taking buprenorphine for opiate substitution during pregnancy and lactation collected foremilk and hindmilk samples with each feeding for 24 hours. The average maternal dosage was 9.3 mg daily and the median was 7 mg daily (range 2.4 to 24 mg daily). The average buprenorphine concentration in milk was 3.65 mcg/L and the average norbuprenorphine concentration was 1.94 mcg/L. These corresponded to daily dosages of 0.55 and 0.29 mcg/kg, respectively and weight-adjusted dosages of 0.38% and 0.18% of the maternal dosage, respectively.[14] Infant Levels. Six nursing infants from 5 to 8 days of age whose mothers were taking a median daily dose of 0.29 mg/kg of buprenorphine had one urine sample collected between 4 and 20 hours after the previous maternal dose. Buprenorphine was undetectable (  < 187 ng/L) in 3 infants; the other 3 had urine concentrations of about 468 ng/L. Norbuprenorphine urine concentrations ranged from 414 to 1987 ng/L (median 952 ng/L). A seventh 9-month-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking 20 mg (0.32 mg/kg) of buprenorphine daily had serum and urine collected. Serum concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were 234 ng/L and 745 ng/L, respectively, at 2.25 hours after the previous maternal dose. A urine sample obtained 3.5 hours after the previous maternal dose contained   < 234 ng/L and 455 ng/L of the drug and metabolite, respectively.[13]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Numerous infants have been reported to breastfeed during maternal narcotic abstinence therapy with buprenorphine with no adverse effects,[8][11][15][16][17] one for 6 months.[15] The amounts of buprenorphine in milk may not be sufficient to prevent neonatal withdrawal, and treatment of infant may be required.[10][18] Despite breastfeeding and relatively high infant serum drug levels, mild buprenorphine withdrawal occurred in the neonate of a mother taking buprenorphine 4 mg daily (route not specified) during pregnancy and postpartum for heroin addiction.[8] This indicates that an insufficient dosage appeared in milk to prevent neonatal abstinence. Ten women who had undergone cesarean section delivery of term newborns were given extradural buprenorphine 200 mcg followed by 8.4 mcg/hour with an anesthetic for postoperative pain for 3 days postpartum. A control group of 10 other women were given extradural anaesthetic only without buprenorphine. Over 11 days postpartum, newborns of mothers in the buprenorphine group had much lower milk intake and lower weight gain than those in the non-buprenorphine group. The authors suggested that extradural buprenorphine suppressed infant breastfeeding. Infant neurobehavioral assessments were not performed.[19] Six infants whose mothers were taking buprenorphine during pregnancy and postpartum were breastfed. Four of the infants had signs of opioid abstinence, indicating that the amounts of buprenorphine in breastmilk were inadequate to prevent withdrawal. At 1 month after discharge from the hospital, all infants had normal development and weight gain.[13] Seven infant who averaged 1.12 months of age (range 0.58 to 1.85 months) were being breastfed by mothers taking buprenorphine for opiate substitution during pregnancy and lactation. Urine screening indicated that 4 mothers had also been using cannabis, 1 was using unprescribed benzodiazepines, and 1 mother was using both cannabis and benzodiazepines. Four of the infants were exclusively breastfed and 3 were mostly breastfed. Infants had no apparent drug-related adverse effects and showed satisfactory developmental progress.[14] A mother used buprenorphine (dose and indication not stated) during pregnancy. Her infant displayed no signs of neonatal abstinence at birth. The infant was breastfed (extent not stated) until 4 months of age when the mother stopped breastfeeding. Two days later the infant had withdrawal symptoms including frequent yawning, sneezing, pupillary dilation, agitation, sweating, hyperactive Moro reflex, myoclonic jerks, tremors, and insomnia. The infant was given methadone with immediate improvement of her withdrawal symptoms. The infant's withdrawal symptoms were probably caused by abrupt withdrawal of breastfeeding.[20] In a study of 7 women taking buprenorphine in a median dose of 7 mg daily (range 2.4 to 24 mg daily) , breastfed infants were followed-up at 3 and 4 weeks of age. Four infants were exclusively breastfed and 3 were partially breastfed. At the follow-up visits, infants were assessed for weight gain, sleeping patterns, skin color, and elimination and hydration patterns. All infants had values within normal limits for these parameters at follow-up.[21] A cohort of 124 infants exposed during pregnancy to maternal medication for opioid maintenance therapy were followed postpartum in a Norwegian study. Forty-six infants were born to mothers taking buprenorphine. Overall, infants who were breastfed had a lower rate of neonatal abstinence symptoms and a shorter duration of therapy for neonatal abstinence. However, the differences were not statistically significant for the subset of infants whose mothers took buprenorphine.[22] A study of pregnant being treated for opiate addiction with buprenorphine at a clinic in Vienna were followed as were their newborn infants. No difference was found between breastfed (n = 31) and nonbreastfed infant (n = 41) in average measures of neonatal abstinence, dosage requirements of morphine, durations of treatment for neonatal abstinence or durations of hospital stays.[23]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Buprenorphine can increase serum prolactin.[23] However, the prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In a multicenter prospective study of 246 pregnant women receiving either methadone or buprenorphine for opiate addiction, 153 women were receiving high-dose buprenorphine. Twenty-two percent of women receiving buprenorphine breastfed their infants, which was the same percentage as those receiving methadone.[24] A case series of opiate-dependent mothers who delivered in a Baby Friendly Hospital found that mothers taking buprenorphine or methadone for opiate addiction were unlikely to breastfeed their infants. Only 45% of the 20 mothers on buprenorphine maintenance initiated breastfeeding. Of all women in the study, 60% discontinued breastfeeding before discharge from the hospital.[25] A retrospective case series reported on 85 opioid-dependent women maintained on buprenorphine during pregnancy and postpartum during the period of December 2007 to August 2012. Of these women, 65 were breastfeeding on discharge from the hospital and 66% of these were breastfeeding at their 6- to 8-week follow-up appointment (extent of nursing not stated).[26] A retrospective cohort study in Australia compared breastfeeding rates on discharge of drug-using mothers who were taking either buprenorphine, other opiates or nonopiates (e.g., benzodiazepines, amphetamines, cocaine, alcohol, inhalants, cannabinoids, psychotropics). Breastfeeding rates at discharge from the hospital were as follows: buprenorphine 27%, other opiates 31%, and nonopiates 51%.[27] A small retrospective study found that only 3 of 10 pregnant women treated with buprenorphine plus naloxone for opioid dependence were breastfeeding their infants at the time of hospital discharge.[28]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited data indicate that butorphanol is excreted into breastmilk in small amounts. Butorphanol is poorly orally absorbed, so it is unlikely to adversely affect the breastfed infant. However, because there is no published experience with repeated, high, intravenous or intranasal doses of butorphanol during breastfeeding, other agents may be preferred in these situations, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. Monitor the infant for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants. As with other narcotics, once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to limit maternal intake and to supplement analgesia with a nonnarcotic analgesic if necessary for pain control. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately. Labor pain medication may delay the onset of lactation."

Intranasal and parenteral doses of 25 to 30 mcg/kg have been used in infants as young as 6 months for postoperative analgesia. Maternal Levels: Twelve lactating women were given a single butorphanol dose at 2 to 4 days postpartum. Six of these women were given a 2 mg single intramuscular dose and 6 others were given a single 8 mg oral dose. Milk was sampled 3 times after the dose. The reported average milk levels were 1.5, 0.7 and 0.3 mcg/L at 2, 4 and 8 hours, respectively, after the 2 mg intramuscular dose. The average milk levels after the 8 mg oral dose were 3.6, 1.8 and 1.1 mcg/L at 3, 5 and 8 hours, respectively. The half-life of elimination from milk was about 2 hours.[1] Using the data from this study, doses of butorphanol 2 mg intramuscularly or 8 mg orally will result in average milk levels of 0.7 and 2 mcg/L, respectively, over 8 hours after the dose. Using these calculated average milk levels, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.035 mcg/kg from a 2 mg intramuscular maternal dose of butorphanol, and 0.1 mcg/kg from an 8 mg oral maternal dose of butorphanol, from milk ingested up through 8 hours after the dose. These amounts represent 0.11% and 0.08% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosages, respectively. Infant Levels:  Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

A study compared women who received butorphanol or nalbuphine during labor (n = 26) to those who received no analgesia (n = 22). The time to effective breastfeeding was longer (46.5 minutes) in the analgesia group than in the no analgesia group (35.4 minutes).[4] A national survey of women and their infants from late pregnancy through 12 months postpartum compared the time of lactogenesis II in mothers who did and did not receive pain medication during labor. Categories of medication were spinal or epidural only, spinal or epidural plus another medication, and other pain medication only. Women who received medications from any of the categories had about twice the risk of having delayed lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) compared to women who received no labor pain medication.[5]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Carbamazepine has relatively high levels in breastmilk and breastfed infants have serum levels that are measurable, but usually below the anticonvulsant therapeutic range. Most infants have had no adverse reactions, but sedation, poor sucking, withdrawal reactions and 3 cases of hepatic dysfunction have been reported. These have all been complicated because of intrauterine exposure and, in some cases, concurrent drug therapy. Breastfeeding during carbamazepine monotherapy does not appear to adversely affect infant growth or development, and breastfed infants had higher IQs and enhanced verbal abilities than nonbreastfed infants at 6 years of age in one study.[1] Monitor the infant for jaundice, drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of anticonvulsant or psychotropic drugs. One author recommends monitoring infant serum carbamazepine levels, liver enzymes, and a complete blood count during therapy.[2]"
    drug_levels: "In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. Three women taking carbamazepine and phenytoin for epilepsy had carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite measured in breastmilk. One woman receiving 6 mg/kg daily had carbamazepine milk levels of 1.8, 1.3 and 1.8 mg/L and epoxide metabolite levels of 0.7, 0.5 and 1.1 mg/L on days 2, 3 and 30 postpartum, respectively. A second woman taking carbamazepine 5.8 mg/kg daily had milk carbamazepine levels of 1.5 and 1.8 mg/L and epoxide metabolite levels of 0.7 and 0.9 mg/L at 3 and 5 weeks postpartum, respectively. The third woman taking carbamazepine 7.3 mg/kg daily had a carbamazepine milk level of 1.5 mg/L and epoxide metabolite level of 0.5 mg/L at 3 weeks postpartum.[3][4] Three carbamazepine breastmilk levels were measured between days 3 and 32 postpartum at unstated times after the dose in an unstated number of women who were taking carbamazepine and other anticonvulsants in unstated dosages. Carbamazepine milk levels averaged 1.9 mg/L (range 0.8 to 3.8 mg/L), while maternal serum levels averaged 4.3 mg/L[5] An epileptic woman was taking carbamazepine 1 g daily and primidone 1 g daily during pregnancy and postpartum. At 5 weeks postpartum, a milk sample was measured. The milk fat contained 1.4 mg/L while the skimmed portion contained 2.3 mg/L of carbamazepine.[6]Four mothers taking carbamazepine monotherapy in an average dosage of 10.95 mg/kg daily had average milk levels of 1.78 mg/L at various times during the first month postpartum. Carbamazepine epoxide milk levels measured in 3 of the women averaged 0.39 mg/L.[7]Sixteen women taking carbamazepine alone or with other anticonvulsants had breastmilk levels measured, 14 during the first week postpartum, 1 at 24 days and 1 at 35 days postpartum. Their average dosage was 13.8 mg/kg daily. Milk carbamazepine levels averaged 2.5 mg/L. Carbamazepine epoxide was measured in the milk of 6 of the women and averaged 1.5 mg/L. In 9 of the women, milk carbamazepine levels were measured on more than 1 occasion; no marked interday differences were found.[8] Six women taking carbamazepine at an average dosage of 733 mg daily (range 600 to 1000 mg daily) had an average breastmilk carbamazepine level of 2.4 mg/L (range 1.2 to 3.4 mg/L) during the first week postpartum. Milk levels averaged 50% (range 32 to 80%) of maternal serum levels.[9] One mother taking carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily had breastmilk carbamazepine levels of 2.8 and 2.2 mg/L at 2 and 63 days postpartum.[10] A woman was taking carbamazepine 300 mg twice daily plus fluoxetine and buspirone for bipolar disorder. Her breastmilk carbamazepine levels were unmeasurable (  < 0.5 mg/L) on day 13 postpartum and 0.5 mg/L on day 21 postpartum.[11] Breastmilk levels of carbamazepine and its metabolite were measured in one milk sample taken 8 hours after a dose of 200 mg of carbamazepine. The carbamazepine concentration was 2.3 mg/L and the carbamazepine epoxide concentration was 1.5 mg/L[12] Seven women taking an average of 520 mg (range 250 to 800 mg daily) of carbamazepine daily had breastmilk levels measured on 1 or more occasions during the first 34 days postpartum, although all but 2 levels were taken during the first 5 days. The average milk levels of carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite were 3.5 and 1.3 mg/L, respectively. Milk levels of the drug and metabolite were 64% and 79% of simultaneous     Maternal Levels:[13] Fifty-four women taking carbamazepine had paired measurements of serum and breastmilk carbamazepine taken at 6 to 10 days postpartum; 31 of them also had carbamazepine epoxide measured. Serum carbamazepine levels varied from 1.4 to 9.0 mg/L and serum carbamazepine epoxide levels ranged from 0.1 to 5.4 mg/L. Milk carbamazepine levels ranged from 0.0 to 6.7 mg/L; milk carbamazepine epoxide levels ranged from 0.0 to 3.7 mg/L.[14] Infant Levels. An infant whose mother was taking carbamazepine 6 mg/kg daily during pregnancy and postpartum had carbamazepine serum levels of 1.1, 1.3 and 1.8 mg/L days 2, 3 and 30 of age, respectively. The epoxide metabolite was only detectable on day 2 at a concentration of 0.3 mg/L. Another infant whose mother was taking carbamazepine 5.8 mg/kg daily during pregnancy and postpartum had a carbamazepine serum level of 0.5 mg/L and undetectable epoxide metabolite level at 5 weeks of age. Infant carbamazepine serum levels in these 2 infants averaged 44% of the simultaneous maternal carbamazepine serum levels.[3][4] Three breastfed infants had steady-state serum carbamazepine levels measured during maternal therapy. The mother's dosages and corresponding infant serum levels are as follows: 10.3 mg/kg daily and 0.5 mg/L at 5 days of age; 22 mg/kg daily and 1 mg/L at 28 days of age; and, 10.6 mg/kg and 4.7 mg/L at 28 days of age. The latter mother was also taking ethosuximide and clonazepam. The epoxide metabolite was not measured.[7] An infant whose mother was taking carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily had serum carbamazepine levels of 1.8 and 1.1 mg/L at 2 days and 63 days of age. The infant was exclusively breastfed for 9 days and partially breastfed thereafter.[10] Total and free carbamazepine levels of 0.7 and 0.22 mg/L, respectively, were measured in a breastfed 3-month-old whose mother was taking carbamazepine 200 mg in the morning and 300 mg at bedtime (about 8 mg/kg daily). The serum sample was taken about 14 hours after the last dose. Total and free levels were 15% and 20% of the simultaneous maternal serum total and free levels.[15] Fifty-four breastfed infants whose mothers were taking carbamazepine had serum samples taken between 6 and 10 days postpartum. Maternal serum carbamazepine levels varied from 1.4 to 9.0 mg/L and serum carbamazepine epoxide levels ranged from 0.1 to 5.4 mg/L. Infant serum carbamazepine levels ranged between 0 and 2.6 mg/L. In 31 infants who also had serum carbamazepine epoxide measured, levels ranged from 0.0 to  0.6 mg/L. The infant/maternal serum concentration ratio ranged from 0 to 0.7 and the epoxide ratio ranged from 0 to 3. No correlation between maternal serum and infant serum was found. Maternal co-administration of enzyme-inducers decreased the value of the carbamazepine infant/maternal serum concentration ratio.[14]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "No adverse effects were noted by the mothers in 3 breastfed infants during maternal carbamazepine and phenytoin therapy.[4] An epileptic woman taking carbamazepine 1 g and primidone 1 g daily during pregnancy and postpartum breastfed her infant for 5 weeks and noted no difference in activity in the infant before and after nursing.[6] A probable case of drug-induced drowsiness occurred in a newborn whose mother was taking primidone, carbamazepine and phenytoin (dosages not stated). At day 30, breastfeeding was discontinued because of the drowsiness that occurred after each feeding and poor weight gain. The same group of researchers found that 15 partially breastfed infants whose mothers were taking various anticonvulsants, including carbamazepine, gained weight at a slower rate during the first 5 days postpartum than did 75 infants of epileptic mothers who bottle fed or control mothers taking no medications.[16]A 10-week-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking clemastine, phenytoin and carbamazepine was drowsy, refused to feed, was irritable, and had high-pitched crying.[17] These side effects were possibly caused by clemastine in breastmilk, but the other drugs could also have contributed. Poor sucking, vomiting and lack of weight gain was reported in a partially breastfed 4-week-old whose mother was taking carbamazepine monotherapy in a dose of 11 mg/kg daily.[7] Weak sucking occurred in 1 of 15 breastfed infants whose mothers were on carbamazepine monotherapy, but a causal relationship could not be confirmed.[8] A breastfed infant whose mother was taking primidone 375 mg, phenobarbital 90 mg, and carbamazepine 800 mg daily did well despite a saliva phenobarbital level of 3.4 mg/L. At 7 months of age, after the mother abruptly stop nursing, the infant had a number of \"startle reactions\" and infantile seizures occurred which were confirmed by an abnormal electroencephalogram. Continued phenobarbital administration to the infant for 15 months controlled the seizures and no more occurred up to 5 years of age.[18]A 3-week-old infant whose mother was taking carbamazepine monotherapy 600 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum had persistent jaundice from birth. Cholestasis and elevated hepatic transaminases were found. Jaundice slowly resolved after discontinuation of breastfeeding on day 17 of life, but transaminase values increased to a peak 6.5 weeks after discontinuation of breastfeeding. Cholestatic hepatitis was possibly caused by carbamazepine exposure in utero and in breastmilk.[19] An infant was born to a mother who was taking carbamazepine monotherapy 400 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. The infant was exclusively breastfed for 9 days, then partially breastfed. Jaundice was present at birth and serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were elevated and remained elevated for at least 25 days, even after bilirubin levels decreased. The infant had a rare form of ABO incompatibility, but this was not thought to fully explain the elevated GGT levels. At 2, 4 and 6 months of age, the infant was developing normally. Serum carbamazepine levels were 1.8 and 1.1 mg/L at 2 days and 63 days of age. The transient hepatic dysfunction was possibly caused by carbamazepine exposure in utero and in breastmilk.[10] In a telephone follow-up study, mothers reported no side effects among 6 infants exposed to carbamazepine (ages and dosages not stated) in breastmilk.[20]One author reported a mother who was taking clonazepam 6 mg daily and carbamazepine 1400 mg daily. The infant had serum clonazepam levels of about 40% of the mother's serum level. Her infant was described as \"somewhat lazy at the breast and tired.\" Carbamazepine levels were not repoted.[21] Possible drug-induced seizure-like activity and cyanosis occurred in a breastfed 3-week-old whose mother was taking fluoxetine, carbamazepine and buspirone during pregnancy and postpartum.[11] A breastfed 3-month-old whose mother was taking carbamazepine 200 mg in the morning and 300 mg at bedtime had normal liver function tests.[15] A fullterm infant whose mother was taking carbamazepine 400 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum developed asphyxia at birth and required mechanical ventilation. Transient jaundice and liver enzyme elevation were attributed to asphyxia. The mother began breastfeeding on day 8 postpartum. At 3 to 7 weeks of age, cholestasis, jaundice and elevation of hepatic transaminases occurred. The late hepatic abnormalities were considered to be probably caused by carbamazepine in breastmilk.[22] Two infants were breastfed during maternal therapy with carbamazepine 600 and 1200 mg daily and levetiracetam. The infants appeared to remain healthy throughout the 6- to 8-week study period.[23] In a long-term study on infants exposed to anticonvulsants during breastfeeding, no difference in average intelligence quotient at 3 years of age was found between infants who were breastfed (n = 26) a median of 6 months and those not breastfed (n = 32) when their mothers were taking carbamazepine.[24] Breastfeeding during carbamazepine monotherapy does not appear to adversely affect infant growth or development, and breastfed infants had slightly higher IQs and enhanced verbal abilities than nonbreastfed infants at 6 years of age in one study.[3] Combination therapy with sedating anticonvulsants or psychotropics may result in infant sedation or withdrawal reactions. A prospective cohort study in Norway followed infants of mothers who took antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and lactation and compared to infants with mothers with untreated epilepsy and infants with fathers who took antiepileptics as control groups Of the 223 mothers studied, 48 were taking carbamazepine monotherapy. Infants were assessed at 6, 18 and 36 months of age. Continuous breastfeeding in children of women using antiepileptic drugs was associated with no greater impaired development than those with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for less than 6 months.[25][26]"

Carisoprodol has a half-life of 4 hours and meprobamate has a half-life of about 10 hours.[1] Maternal Levels. A mother was taking carisoprodol 700 mg three times daily during pregnancy and lactation. Maternal trough breastmilk levels of carisoprodol and meprobamate were measured before the first morning dose on 4 consecutive days at steady-state (time postpartum not stated). Average minimum breastmilk levels were 0.9 mg/L for carisoprodol and 11.6 mg/L for meprobamate. The authors calculated that the minimum infant dose of the drug plus metabolite was 1.9 mg/kg daily or 4.1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Extrapolating these results to an average (rather than minimum) dose, the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 3 mg/kg daily or 6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[1] A woman who was suspected to have been abusing carisoprodol had the drug and meprobamate detectable in breastmilk for 2 consecutive days after hospitalization; only meprobamate was detectable on day 3.[2] A woman took carisoprodol 700 mg orally four times daily at 4- to 6-hour intervals during pregnancy and lactation for spasms of the  back muscles. At 1 week postpartum, breastmilk samples were obtained 2 and 3.5 hours after doses of the drug. Two hours after a dose, carisoprodol concentration in milk was 1.4 mg/L and meprobamate was 10.9 mg/L. At 3.5 hours after the following dose, carisoprodol concentration in milk was 0.8 mg/L and meprobamate was 17.1 mg/L. The authors estimated that the maximum intake of carisoprodol plus meprobamate was 2.7 mg/kg daily or 6.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[3] Infant Levels: A mother took carisoprodol 700 mg orally four times daily at 4- to 6-hour intervals during pregnancy and lactation. At 1 week postpartum, her exclusively breastfed infant had unmeasurable serum concentrations of carisoprodol (  < 2 mg/L) and meprobamate (  < 4 mg/L) 2 hours after nursing (3.5 hours after the mother's previous dose). The investigators hypothesized that either the dose received by the infant was low or the infant's metabolism of the drugs may have been stimulated from the exposure during pregnancy.[3]"

    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A cohort study of infants diagnosed with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis found that affected infants were 2.3 to 3 times more likely to have a mother taking a macrolide antibiotic during the 90 days after delivery. Stratification of the infants found the odds ratio to be 10 for female infants and 2 for male infants. All of the mothers of affected infants nursed their infants. Most of the macrolide prescriptions were for erythromycin, but only 1.7% were for clarithromycin. However, the authors did not state which macrolide was taken by the mothers of the affected infants.[2] A study comparing the breastfed infants of mothers taking amoxicillin to those taking a macrolide antibiotic found no instances of pyloric stenosis. However, most of the infants exposed to a macrolide in breastmilk  were exposed to roxithromycin. Only 6 of the 55 infants exposed to a macrolide were exposed to clarithromycin. Adverse reactions occurred in 12.7% of the infants exposed to macrolides which was similar to the rate in amoxicillin-exposed infants. Reactions included  rash, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and somnolence.[3] A retrospective database study in Denmark of 15 years of data found a 3.5-fold increased risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in the infants of mothers who took a macrolide during the first 13 days postpartum, but not with later exposure. The proportion of infants who were breastfed was not known, but probably high. The proportion of women who took each macrolide was also not reported.[4]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Maternal clonazepam occasionally causes sedation in their breastfed infants, especially when given with other central nervous system depressants. Monitor the infant for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of psychotropic drugs. Monitoring of the infant's serum concentration may be indicated if excessive sedation occurs. Because it has a long half-life, a safer, shorter-acting drug should be used as  rather than clonazepam.[1][2]"
    drug_levels: "In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. A breastfed newborn infant whose mother was taking clonazepam during pregnancy and lactation (dosage not stated) had serum levels that increased from about 23 mcg/L at 24 hours of age to 43 mcg/L at 96 hours of age.[3] Repeated milk clonazepam levels were between 11 and 13 mcg/L in a woman taking clonazepam in an unstated dosage.[4] A mother taking clonazepam 2 mg twice daily had severl milk level measurements on days 2 to 4 postpartum. The highest milk level was 10.7 mcg/L 4 hours after a dose. The authors calculated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a maximum of 2.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of clonazepam.[5] A mother who was taking clonazepam 6 mg daily and carbamazepine 1400 mg daily had a milk clonazepam level of 12 mcg/L. No details on sampling times were provided.[6] Infant Levels: One preterm infant had cord blood levels of 19 mcg/L and was not breastfed until 72 hours after delivery. The infant's serum clonazepam level was 2.9 mcg/L at 120 hours after birth, and 1 mcg/L at day 14. The mother's serum level was 32 mcg/L at delivery and repeated milk clonazepam levels were between 11 and 13 mcg/L.[4] A newborn infant was breastfeeding during a maternal dosage of clonazepam 2 mg twice daily. A pooled sample of infant serum from days 2 to 4 of age contained 4.7 mcg/L of clonazepam.[5] Ten of 11 breastfed infants whose mothers were taking clonazepam in dosages of 0.25 to 2 mg daily had no detectable (assay limit varied from 5 to 14 mcg/L) clonazepam or metabolites in serum. The infants' average age was 7.9 weeks, but 6 were under 1 month of age. One 1.9 week-old-infant whose mother was taking clonazepam 0.5 mg daily had a serum concentration of 22 mcg/L.[7]One author reported a mother who was taking clonazepam 6 mg daily and carbamazepine 1400 mg daily. Her breastfed (extent not stated) infant had a serum clonazepam level of 20 mcg/L, while the mother's serum level was 50 mcg/L.[6]"

The neonate was breastfed starting at 72 hours after delivery and her mother took clonazepam (dose not stated) during pregnancy and lactation. The repeated periodic breathing episodes continued up to 10 weeks of age and were possibly related to clonazepam in breastmilk. A neurodevelopmental examination was normal at 5 months of age.[4] The infant of a mother taking clonazepam 1 mg daily during pregnancy and lactation was rated as highly apathetic and had decreased weight increase and slight neurologic signs at 4 weeks of age, but normal intelligence at 6 years of age.[8]	  None of 11 infants whose mothers were taking clonazepam in dosages ranging from 0.25 to 2 mg daily (including 4 who were taking other psychotropic drugs also) had any side effects reported by their mothers. The infants' average age was 7.9 weeks, but 6 were under 1 month of age.[7] One author reported a mother who was taking clonazepam 6 mg daily and carbamazepine 1400 mg daily. The infant had serum clonazepam levels of about 40% of the mother's serum level. Her infant was described as \"somewhat lazy at the breast and tired.\"[6] In a telephone follow-up study, 124 mothers who took a benzodiazepine while nursing reported whether their infants had any signs of sedation. Twenty-two mothers took clonazepam while breastfeeding and 1 reported sedation in her infant. She was taking clonazepam 0.25 mg twice daily, flurazepam 15 mg daily, 1 mg of bupropion daily, and 0.75 mg of risperidone daily.[9]All adverse reactions in breastfed infants reported in France between January 1985 and June 2011 were compiled by a French pharmacovigilance center. Of 174 reports, clonazepam was reported to cause adverse reactions in 5 infants and to be one of the drugs most often suspected in serious adverse reactions, primarily sedation. One two-month old infant had well-documented hypotonia, somnolence and apnea caused by clonazepam in breastmilk.[10]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Maternal use of codeine during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, central nervous system depression and even death, with pharmacogenetics possibly playing a role.[1][2] Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral codeine to 4 days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring.[2][3][4] If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately.[5] Excessive sedation in the mother often correlates with excess sedation in the breastfed infant. Following these precautions can lower the risk of neonatal sedation.[6] The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that other agents are preferred over codeine during breastfeeding,[7] Both the European Medicines Agency and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommend that codeine not be used in nursing mothers;[8] however, other opioid alternatives have been studied less and may not be safer.[9]"
    drug_levels: "Codeine is metabolized via CYP2D6 to morphine (5%), norcodeine (15%), and further to codeine-6-glucuronide (80%) and morphine-6-glucuronide by UGT2B7. Codeine itself has very weak analgesic activity. The morphine and codeine-6-glucuronide metabolites are responsible for codeine's analgesic properties. Both CYP2D6 and UGT2B7 are subject to genetic variability which can alter the amount of active narcotic excreted into breastmilk. The plasma clearance of morphine is prolonged in newborn infants compared to older infants and children.[2][10] Maternal Levels: Two mothers who were 7 and 13 weeks postpartum were given a single 60 mg dose of oral codeine. Milk was collected over 12 hours in the first subject and over 48 hours in the second. Codeine and morphine were detected in the milk of both subjects with peak codeine levels in milk occurring 1 hour after the dose. The peak codeine milk level was 455 mcg/L in the first subject and about 450 to 550 mcg/L in the second. The half-life of codeine in breastmilk was 2.5 hours. Morphine milk levels were 16 mcg/L and 9 mcg/L 1 hour after the dose in the 2 subjects. Elimination of morphine from milk occurred very slowly over 36 hours. The authors calculated an average milk level from 0 to 12 hours after a single codeine 60 mg dose to be 140 mcg/L for codeine and 9 mcg/L for morphine. They also estimated an average steady-state codeine milk concentration of 351 mcg/L and morphine milk concentration of 42 mcg/L from a codeine dose of 60 mg every 4 hours.[11] Using the average milk level data from this study, including the contribution of the morphine metabolite, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated maximum dose of 11 mcg/kg in the 12 hours after a single 60 mg maternal dose and 59 mcg/kg daily from a maternal dosage regimen of 60 mg taken every 4 hours. The amounts of codeine and morphine in milk in this study represent an infant dosage of about 1.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted codeine dosage. The typical neonatal dose of codeine is 500 mcg/kg every 6 to 8 hours. The levels of codeine-6-glucuronide were not measured in this study and thus, results likely underestimate complete infant exposure to active substances in milk from maternal codeine use. Seven mothers who were 1 to 3 days postpartum and taking codeine 60 mg every 4 to 6 hours for an average of 4 doses had foremilk sampled up to 6 hours after a dose. One mother's serial milk levels at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after the dose were 71, 71, 199, and 126 mcg/L for codeine and 8.5, 9.1, 11.2, and 12.7 mcg/L for morphine, respectively. Using these levels, a calculated average milk level is 124 mcg/L for codeine and 9.6 mcg/L for morphine. The range of measured milk levels from all subjects was 33.8 to 314 mcg/L for codeine and 1.9 to 20.5 mcg/L morphine. Time to codeine milk level peak was variable. The subject with the highest measured milk codeine level of 314 mcg/L had this measurement 3.5 hours after her fifth dose. One subject had a measurable milk codeine level 35 hours after her twelfth dose.[12][13] Using the calculated average codeine milk level, including the contribution of the morphine metabolite, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated maximum 20 mcg/kg daily from a maternal dosage regimen of 60 mg taken every 4 hours. This represents an infant dosage of 0.3% of the maternal weight adjusted dosage. Using the peak codeine and morphine milk levels from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated maximum of 50 mcg/kg daily from a maternal dosage regimen of 60 mg taken every 4 to 6 hours. This represents 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. The typical neonatal dose of codeine is 500 mcg/kg every 6 to 8 hours. The levels of codeine-6-glucuronide were not measured in this study and thus, results likely underestimate complete infant exposure to active substances in milk from maternal codeine use. A mother took codeine 60 mg with acetaminophen every 12 hours for 2 days postpartum, then codeine 30 mg every 12 hours for episiotomy pain. A pumped milk sample from day 10 postpartum (time with respect to dose not stated) contained 87 mcg/L of morphine which was several times higher than expected. Genetic analysis revealed that she was heterozygous for CYP2D6*2A with a CYP2D6*2x2 gene duplication classifying her as an ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizer.[14] A follow-up study of nursing mothers who had taken codeine during nursing found that mothers who reported central nervous system depression during codeine use were more likely to have CYP2D6 duplication and UGT2B7 *2/*2 genotype than those who reported no central nervous system depression.[15] Infant Levels: Plasma samples from 11 healthy, term, 1- to 3-day-old infants of 11 mothers taking codeine for post partum analgesia were drawn 1 to 4 hours after completion of breastfeeding. The mothers had taken an average of 4 doses of oral codeine 60 mg every 4 to 6 hours for analgesia prior to infant plasma sampling. One hour after a dose the mean infant serum codeine level was 1.86 mcg/L (range 0.8 to 4.5 mcg/L). At 2 hours the mean was 1.15 mcg/L (range 0.8 to 1.5 mcg/L). At 4 hours the mean was 1.4 mcg/L (range of 0.8 to 3.3 mcg/L). Mean infant serum morphine levels were 0.86 mcg/L at 1 hour, 0.58 mcg/L at 2 hours and 0.8 mcg/L at 4 hours. The morphine to codeine ratio was higher in infant serum than in milk, possibly due to conversion of codeine to morphine in the infants. The authors noted that the infant serum codeine and morphine levels reported in this study are lower than known therapeutic plasma levels reported in adults and neonates treated with codeine or morphine for analgesia.[13] The levels of codeine-6-glucuronide were not measured in this study and thus, results likely underestimate infant exposure to active substances in milk from maternal codeine use.An author reported two cases. In one, a codeine-dependent mother taking codeine 300 mg daily  breastfed (extent not stated) her infant. The infant's urine contained codeine in a concentration of 1 mg/L (sampling time not stated). In the other case, a heroin-dependent mother was taking 625 mg of codeine daily as a replacement. Dihydrocodeine 1.5 mg/L was measured in the infant's serum. The age and extent of nursing were not reported.[16]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Codeine was reported to be the possible cause of asymptomatic bradycardia 6 days following a 30 mg single maternal codeine dose in a week-old, term, exclusively breastfed infant.[17] Four probable cases of apnea associated with maternal codeine intake of 60 mg every 4 to 6 hours were reported in 4- to 6-day-old term and near-term breastfed infants. Apnea resolved 24 to 48 hours after withholding breast feeding and discontinuation of maternal codeine.[18] In a case-control study of 12 breastfed term newborns with unexplained episodes of apnea, bradycardia or cyanosis during the first week of life, maternal oral codeine use was determined to be the probable cause. A higher proportion of newborns with episodes, 83 vs 31%, had mothers using opiates, including codeine, for postpartum analgesia. The mean number of doses taken was also higher with mothers of case newborns taking a mean of 10 doses (range 4 to 22) vs. 5 doses (range 1 to 13) in the control group. There were no differences in other perinatal and demographic factors between cases and controls.[19] The authors recommended discontinuation of breastfeeding if infants of mothers taking opiate analgesics have unexplained negative cardiorespiratory symptoms. No apnea, bradycardia, or color changes occurred in 11 healthy, term, 1- to 3-day-old newborn breastfed infants exposed to codeine in milk. Their mothers had taken an average of 4 doses of oral codeine 60 mg every 4 to 6 hours prior to breastfeeding.[13] In one telephone follow-up study, 19% (5 of 26) of breastfeeding mothers taking multiple doses of codeine reported drowsiness in their infants. All infants were younger than 1 month.[20] The authors added that the elimination half-life of codeine's metabolite, morphine, is prolonged in the newborn period which may explain why the adverse reaction was reported in only infants younger than 1 month. A heroin-dependent mother was taking 625 mg of codeine daily as a replacement. Her infant (age and extent of nursing not stated) was described as cyanotic and apneic.[16] A large case-control study of 504 children with neuroblastoma found a statistically significant 2.4-fold association of the disease with maternal use of opioid agonists during pregnancy and lactation. This finding was largely attributable to a 3.4-fold association with maternal codeine use. Opioid exposure during lactation had a 3.5-fold association while codeine exposure had a 5.1-fold association. Because neuroblastoma is a sympathetic nervous system tumor arising from the progenitor cells of the sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla, and because codeine does cross the placenta and is transferred to milk, the authors of this study speculate that codeine's neuroendocrine effects could disrupt adrenal gland development in the fetus and neonate thus contributing to neuroblastoma.[21]A breastfed infant became increasingly sleepy and lethargic starting on day 7 of life. The infant developed gray skin and decreased milk intake on day 12 of life and died on day 13 of life. The infant's mother was taking acetaminophen with codeine prescribed for post-episiotomy pain at a codeine dose of 60 mg every 12 hours on days 1 and 2 postpartum, and 30 mg every 12 hours for 2 weeks. The mother was found to be a ultrarapid metabolizer of codeine who excreted very large amounts of morphine into her breastmilk.[14] The authors later conducted a retrospective case-control study of 72 women who had taken codeine while breastfeeding found that 24% of the mothers reported decreased alertness in their infants which improved after codeine or breastfeeding discontinuation. The affected infants were more likely to have visited an emergency room for symptoms such as lethargy, poor feeding or breathing difficulties. Mothers with affected infants took an average of 1.62 mg/kg daily or codeine compared to an average of 1.02 mg/kg daily in mothers of unaffected infants. The lowest maternal dose reported cause symptoms in the breastfed infant was 0.63 mg/kg daily. Usually the mothers of affected infants also had signs of central nervous system depression. Another woman was also an ultrarapid codeine metabolizer in addition to the first case reported. She took 120 mg of codeine daily and her infant was very drowsy and fed poorly and the mother was sedated, nauseated, dizzy, and weak during codeine use. The mother transitioned to complete formula feeding by day 7 postpartum and noted a complete reversal of her infant's symptoms although she remained symptomatic.[22] A study compared the frequency of drowsiness in breastfed infants whose mothers took acetaminophen plus codeine to infants whose mothers took acetaminophen alone. Infants exposed to codeine had a 16.7% frequency of drowsiness compared to 0.5% of those exposed to acetaminophen alone. Mothers having infants with drowsiness took about 50% higher doses of codeine than those with no drowsiness.[23]In a retrospective study, nursing mothers who were taking either codeine, oxycodone or acetaminophen for pain while breastfeeding were contacted by telephone to ascertain the degree of maternally perceived central nervous system (CNS) depression. Some of the mothers taking codeine had been previously reported in reference [22]. Mothers taking codeine reported signs of CNS depression in 17% (35/210) of their infants, while those taking acetaminophen reported infant CNS depression in only 0.5% (1/184) of their infants. Women who reported infant sedation were taking 1.4 mg/kg daily of  oxycodone, and unaffected were taking 0.9 mg/kg daily. Affected infants had more hours of daily uninterrupted sleep than unaffected infants, and 4 of the affected infants had been taken to the emergency department for lethargy. Thirty of 35 mothers reported that infant sedation ceased with maternal codeine discontinuation. Mothers of affected infants were also more likely to experience lethargy and other side effects than mothers of unaffected infants. Mothers who took oxycodone reported a similar rate of infant sedation (20%) compared to codeine, but the groups were statistically different in parity and postmenstrual age (PMA), with the codeine group having a slightly higher PMA.[24] A retrospective cohort study of women with publically funded prescription coverage compared 7804 women who filled a codeine prescription within 7 days postpartum to 7804 who did not over a 10-year period. No difference was found in any adverse infant outcomes during the first 30 days of life between the two groups, including hospitalization for various causes.[25] However, study design problems appear to have limited this study, including a lack of knowledge of maternal codeine dosage ingested, timing of codeine ingestion, and extent of nursing.[26] Six cases of CNS depression in infants breastfed by mothers taking codeine were reported over a 2-year period in Canada. Maternal dosages that were reported were in the range of 2 to 3 mg/kg daily.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Long-term prophylactic maternal doses of colchicine up to 1.5 mg daily produce levels in milk that result in the infant receiving less than 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. The highest milk levels occur 2 to 4 hours after a dose, so avoiding breastfeeding during this time can minimize the infant dose, although some clinicians simply recommend taking the drug after nursing. No adverse effects in breastfed infants have been reported in case series and a case-control study and some authors consider colchicine safe during breastfeeding in women being treated for familial Mediterranean fever.[1][2][3]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A woman receiving long-term oral colchicine 0.6 mg daily had milk levels of colchicine measured 5 times between 16 and 21 days postpartum. Twice, colchicine was undetectable (  < 0.5 mcg/L) in milk 40 minutes after a dose. On other occasions, milk colchicine levels were 1.2 mcg/L 40 minutes after a dose, 2.5 mcg/L 50 minutes after a dose and 1.7 mcg/L 55 minutes after a dose.[4] A woman taking colchicine 1 mg orally once daily had breastmilk colchicine levels of 31 mcg/L at 2 hours after a dose and 24 mcg/L 4 hours after the dose on day 5 postpartum; and 27 mcg/L at 4 hours after the dose and 10 mcg/L at 7 hours after the dose on day 15 postpartum. Using the maximum milk level, the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage in the 8 hours after a dose. They suggested giving colchicine at nighttime and not nursing for 8 hours to minimize infant colchicine exposure.[5] Four women were receiving long-term colchicine therapy 1 to 1.5 mg once daily. Milk samples were taken before and 1, 3 and 6 hours after a colchicine dose on days 4, 6, 21 and 58 of nursing, respectively, in the 4 women. Colchicine was detectable in all milk samples, including the 24-hour predose samples which were less than 1 mcg/L. Peak milk levels occurred 1 hour after the dose in 3 women and 3 hours after the dose in the fourth. Peak milk levels ranged from 1.98 and 8.6 mcg/L. At 6 hours after the dose, milk levels ranged from 0.87 and 2.57 mcg/L. Although the authors did not specify which mothers were taking which dose, milk levels were much higher (  > 1.5 times higher) in the mothers who were 4 and 6 days postpartum compared to those who were 21 and 58 days postpartum. Using the highest measured milk levels, the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 1.2 mcg/kg daily or less than 10% of an adult colchicine dose.[1] Infant Levels: Colchicine was undetectable (  < 5 mcg/L) in 12-hour urine samples taken from a breastfed infant at 5 and 15 days of age whose mother was taking 1 mg of colchicine once daily.[5]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In 4 infants whose mothers were taking 1 to 1.5 mg of colchicine daily prophylactically for familial Mediterranean fever, no apparent effects were noted on clinical follow-up over at least 10 months. The authors also reported that they recalled another 6 women who breastfed their infants for at least 3 months during colchicine therapy (dosage not stated) and follow-up for at least 2 years revealed no clinical or developmental problems.[1] An infant was breastfed (extent not stated) for 6 months during maternal intake of colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily. No apparent adverse effects were noted.[4] In a study of mothers who took colchicine during pregnancy, 111 of 181 mothers reported breastfeeding (extent not stated) their infants. None of the infants reportedly had colchicine-related adverse effects.[6] A case-control study compared 37 women who took colchicine during breastfeeding their 38 infants to a matched control group of 75 mothers who had taken amoxicillin, but were unexposed to colchicine, and their 76 breastfed infants. Telephone follow-up occurred at 6 to 48 months (average 28 months) after the initial inquiry. Among the colchicine-exposed group, 76% of infants were exclusively breastfed and the mean overall duration of breastfeeding was 9.1 months. No increased risk of adverse effects was noted in the colchicine-exposed infants compared to the control infants. Specifically, no differences in gastrointestinal symptoms, or growth and development parameters were seen.[3]"

Other agents are preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.<br><br>  After a single dose of diazepam, as for sedation before a procedure, there is usually no need to wait to resume breastfeeding, although with a newborn or preterm infant, a cautious approach would be to wait a period of 6 to 8 hours before resuming nursing."

Average milk levels of diazepam plus nordiazepam were 79 mcg/L after 4 days (total diazepam dosage130 mg) and 130 mcg/L after 6 days (total diazepam dosage 190 mg). Oxazepam was not detected.[1] In a 1-day postpartum woman, a colostrum diazepam level of 100 mcg/L milk level was found 25 hours after the last of 3 intravenous 5 mg doses of diazepam given over a 4-hour period.[2] Four women were given diazepam 10 mg at bedtime for 6 days, beginning 3 days postpartum. Each had also received intravenous diazepam 20 mg immediately prior to delivery. Milk levels were collected 9.25 and 23.5 hours after each dose from days 3 to 9 postpartum. Milk levels of diazepam and nordiazepam did not differ markedly between the collection times and ranged from 17 to 39 mcg/L for diazepam and 19 to 52 mcg/L for nordiazepam.[3] Breastmilk levels of 27 to 164 mcg/L of diazepam plus nordiazepam were found at various times between 9 days and 3.5 months postpartum during an irregular regimen of 6 to 10 mg daily of oral diazepam in 1 woman.[4]A woman who had been abusing benzodiazepines was taking diazepam 80 mg and oxazepam 30 mg daily at the time of study. Milk samples were taken before and after the morning feeding following the morning dose of diazepam during a 30-day tapering dosage regimen. The average of the pre- and post-feed diazepam milk levels were 185 and 307 mcg/L and average nordiazepam milk levels were 124 and 141 mcg/L on days 14 and 15 during maternal intake of diazepam 40 mg daily. The average of the pre- and post-feed diazepam milk levels were 200 and 158 mcg/L and average nordiazepam milk levels were 140 and 85 mcg/L on days 23 and 25 during maternal intake of diazepam 30 mg daily. The average of the pre- and post-feed diazepam milk levels was 67 mcg/L and average nordiazepam milk levels was 42 mcg/L on days 30 during maternal intake of diazepam 10 mg daily. Nine days after discontinuing diazepam, milk diazepam and nordiazepam were both 6 mcg/L.[5] Eight women who were at least 1 month postpartum received intravenous diazepam during a surgical sterilization procedure. Dosages ranged from 2.5 to 10 mg. Diazepam and nordiazepam were undetectable (  < 150 mcg/L) in the breastmilk of any of the women. The authors estimated that the maximum systemic exposure of one of the breastfed infants would be 3% of the mother's.[6] Infant Levels: Three infants were breastfed from birth while their mothers were receiving diazepam 10 mg 3 times daily. Infant serum levels were measured on days 4 and 6 of life. On day 4, average infant serum levels were 172 mcg/L of diazepam and 243 mcg/L of nordiazepam. On day 6, average infant serum levels dropped to 74 mcg/L of diazepam and 31 mcg/L of nordiazepam, mostly due to a large drop in one of the infants.[1] A fully breastfed infant was 32 days old at the time of serum sampling. His mother was taking diazepam 6 to 10 mg daily and had taken 2 mg of diazepam 10 hours before infant serum samples were taken. The infant's diazepam serum level was 0.7 mcg/L and nordiazepam was 46 mcg/L. The mother's simultaneous serum levels were 100 and 200 mcg/L for the drug and metabolite, respectively.[4]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Three infants were breastfed from birth while their mothers were receiving diazepam 10 mg 3 times daily. The authors noticed no lethargy or hypoventilation in the infants during the 6-day observation period. The authors expressed concern that nordiazepam may compete with bilirubin for hepatic glucuronide conjugation in the neonate.[1] A nursing mother was given diazepam 10 mg orally 3 times a day beginning on day 5 postpartum. Weight loss, lethargy and an EEG consistent with sedative effect in her 8-day-old was probably caused by diazepam or its metabolites in breastmilk.[7] Of 8 infants breastfed from birth during maternal diazepam therapy (dosages unspecified), 3 had mild jaundice during the first few days postpartum, although this was not thought by the authors to be unusual.[8] Sedation was reported in the breastfed newborn infant of a mother taking oral diazepam 6 to 10 mg daily if the infant was nursed within a few hours of a dose, but not if she nursed 8 or more hours after a dose. Infant sedation was probably caused by diazepam and its major metabolite in breastmilk.[4] In a telephone follow-up study, 124 mothers who took a benzodiazepine while nursing reported whether their infants had any signs of sedation. About 10% of mothers took diazepam while breastfeeding and none reported sedation in her infant.[9] In a longitudinal study of women taking medications during breastfeeding, some mothers who were taking diazepam reported discontinuing breastfeeding because of drowsiness in their breastfed infants.[10]"

    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Pyloric stenosis, vomiting, sedation, poor sucking and poor weight gain probably related to erythromycin in breastmilk was reported in a 3-week-old infant.[4] A cohort study of infants diagnosed with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis found that affected infants were 2.3 to 3 times more likely to have a mother taking a macrolide antibiotic during the 90 days after delivery. Stratification of the infants found the odds ratio to be 10 for female infants and 2 for male infants. All of the mothers of affected infants nursed their infants. Seventy-two percent of the macrolide prescriptions were for erythromycin. However, the authors did not state which macrolide was taken by the mothers of the affected infants.[5] A study comparing the breastfed infants of mothers taking amoxicillin to those taking a macrolide antibiotic found no instances of pyloric stenosis. However, most of the infants exposed to a macrolide in breastmilk  were exposed to roxithromycin. Only 2 of the 55 infants exposed to a macrolide were exposed to erythromycin. Adverse reactions occurred in 12.7% of the infants exposed to macrolides which was similar to the rate in amoxicillin-exposed infants. Reactions included  rash, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and somnolence.[6] A retrospective database study in Denmark of 15 years of data found a 3.5-fold increased risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in the infants of mothers who took a macrolide during the first 13 days postpartum, but not with later exposure. The proportion of infants who were breastfed was not known, but probably high. The proportion of women who took each macrolide was also not reported.[7] In one telephone follow-up study, mothers reported diarrhea 2 infants and irritability in 2 infants out of 17 infants whose mothers were taking erythromycin during breastfeeding.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Escitalopram is the <em>S</em>-isomer of the antidepressant, citalopram. Limited information indicates that maternal doses of escitalopram up to 20 mg daily produce low levels in milk and would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants, especially if the infant is older than 2 months. Based on limited data, escitalopram appears to be preferable to racemic citalopram during breastfeeding because of the lower dosage and milk levels and general lack of adverse reactions in breastfed infants. One case of necrotizing enterocolitis was reported in an breastfed newborn whose mother was taking escitalopram during pregnancy and lactation, but causality was not established. Monitor the infant for drowsiness, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of psychotropic drugs. Mothers taking an SSRI during pregnancy and postpartum may have more difficulty breastfeeding and may need additional breastfeeding support. Breastfed infants exposed to an SSRI during the third trimester of pregnancy have a lower risk of poor neonatal adaptation than formula-fed infants."
    drug_levels: "Escitalopram is the S -isomer of racemic citalopram which is metabolized to 2 metabolites, each having antidepressant activity considered to be about 13% that of citalopram.[1] Maternal Levels: Eight women taking escitalopram in an average dosage of 199 mcg/kg daily (10 to 20 mg daily) had 6 to 8 milk steady-state milk samples analyzed over the 24-hour interval after their single daily dose. The average dosage that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive was calculated to be 7.6 mcg/kg of escitalopram and 3 mcg/kg of desmethylcitalopram daily which were 3.9% and 1.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosages, respectively. The absolute dosage was about 40% less than a previous study by the same authors with racemic citalopram.[2] A woman taking escitalopram had milk escitalopram concentrations measured twice. While taking a dosage of 5 mg daily, milk escitalopram was 24.9 mcg/L at 20 hours after the dose. While taking 10 mg escitalopram daily and valproic acid 1200 mg daily, milk escitalopram was 76.1 mcg/L at 15 hours after the dose. Using these two data points, the authors estimated that the infant received 5.1 and 7.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of escitalopram on these days, respectively.[3] One woman was taking escitalopram 20 mg daily and reboxetine 4 mg daily orally while nursing her 9.5-month-old infant. She collected milk samples before each breastfeeding session over a 1-day period. The authors estimated that the infant would receive 4.6% of the maternal-weight-adjusted dosage of escitalopram plus desmethylescitalopram.[4] Infant Levels: One study found that racemic citalopram serum levels in infants were determined by their CYP2C19 genotype, with slow metabolizers more likely to have detectable serum levels.[5] Pharmacogenetics likely plays a part in determining the exposure of breastfed infants to escitalopram also. In 8 breastfed infants whose mothers were taking an average of 199 mcg/kg daily of escitalopram (10 or 20 mg daily), escitalopram and desmethylescitalopram were undetectable in the serum of 3 infants (  < 1 mcg/L). The drug and metabolite serum levels were less than 5 mcg/L in all the other infants. Their mothers' serum levels of the drug and metabolite averaged 24 and 20 mcg/L, respectively.[2]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Eight breastfed infants whose mothers were taking escitalopram in an average dose of 199 mcg/kg daily for postpartum depression were evaluated by a pediatric specialist using the Denver developmental scale. Their mothers had taken escitalopram for a median of 55 days postpartum (range 23 to 240 days). The infants' scores on this scale was 110% of normal.[2] A woman began taking escitalopram 5 mg daily immediately after birth. Her dosage was increased to 10 mg daily and valproic acid 1200 mg daily was added by 7 weeks postpartum. Her breastfed infant was judged to be healthy and have normal neuropsychological development by a general practitioner at 7.5 weeks of age.[3] One woman was taking escitalopram 20 mg daily and reboxetine 4 mg daily orally while nursing her infant (extent not stated). She had taken reboxetine for 1.5 months, but the start of her escitalopram therapy was not stated. At 9.5 months of age, her breastfed infant had normal weight gain and a Denver developmental score of 105% of chronological age.[4] A nursing mother was given escitalopram 10 mg daily for depression beginning at 3 weeks postpartum and increasing to 20 mg daily thereafter. At 4 months of age, her exclusively breastfed infant was admitted to the hospital for irritability, vomiting and fever of 4 days duration. He had been irritable with prolonged periods of crying for the past 3 months according to his mother and had gained only 400 grams per month since birth. Liver enzymes were moderately elevated. The infant was discharged after 5 days and breastfeeding was continued, but only twice daily for 2 weeks, then discontinued at 4.5 months of age. At 5 months, symptom improvement was noted and at 6 months, serum liver enzymes had normalized. The author noted that the time course of the adverse effects were consistent with the treatment with escitalopram.[6] A mother began taking escitalopram 20 mg daily in the morning on day 15 postpartum. She exclusively breastfed her infant on demand. At 3 months of age, no adverse effects had been reported in the infant by his pediatrician.[7] At 5 days of age, an infant was readmitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis. The infant had spent the first 2 days of life in intensive care because of respiratory distress. The infant's mother had taken escitalopram 20 mg daily throughout pregnancy and while breastfeeding (extent not stated). The authors hypothesized that escitalopram might have been responsible for the enterocolitis because of its effect on platelet aggregation.[8] The drug was possibly a cause of the reaction. One author reported on the newborn infant of a mother who was taking escitalopram (dose and duration not stated). The hyperirritable infant had high-pitched crying 2 hours after breastfeeding every afternoon which was 5 to 6 hours after maternal dose of escitalopram. Changing the time of the mother's escitalopram dose resulted in a shift in the time of the infant's crying at the same time interval after the dose. The infant's symptoms improved with partial substitution of formula and ceased on day 11 of life with complete formula feeding.[9] An uncontrolled online survey compiled data on 930 mothers who nursed their infants while taking an antidepressant. Infant drug discontinuation symptoms (e.g., irritability, low body temperature, uncontrollable crying, eating and sleeping disorders) were reported in about 10% of infants. Mothers who took antidepressants only during breastfeeding were much less likely to notice symptoms of drug discontinuation in their infants than those who took the drug in pregnancy and lactation.[10] A 6.5-month-old infant developed severe vomiting and an apparent tonic seizure after being breastfed by her mother. The mother had been taking escitalopram 10 mg daily since birth and had begun extended-release bupropion 150 mg daily 3 weeks earlier. The seizure occurred 8 hours after the mother's morning dose of bupropion. The infant's mother had noted disturbances in sleep behavior, unusual movements, and unresponsiveness followed by sleep on several previous occasions. The baby was partially breastfed, also receiving pumped breastmilk, formula, and solid foods. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the baby was discharged after being asymptomatic for 48 hours. The seizure was probably drug-related, most likely caused by bupropion and hydroxybupropion in breastmilk, but a contribution by escitalopram cannot be ruled out.[11] A cohort of 247 infants exposed to an antidepressant in utero during the third trimester of pregnancy were assessed for poor neonatal adaptation (PNA). Of the 247 infants, 154 developed PNA. Infants who were exclusively given formula had about 3 times the risk of developing PNA as those who were exclusively or partially breastfed. None of the infants were exposed to escitalopram in utero, but 51 were exposed to citalopram, the racemic form of the drug.[12]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "The SSRI class of drugs, including escitalopram, can cause increased prolactin levels and galactorrhea in nonpregnant, nonnursing patients.[13][14][15][16][17][18][19] Euprolactinemic galactorrhea has also been reported.[20][21] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In a small prospective study, 8 primiparous women who were taking a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI; 3 taking fluoxetine and 1 each taking citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, paroxetine or sertraline) were compared to 423 mothers who were not taking an SRI. Mothers taking an SRI had an onset of milk secretory activation (lactogenesis II) that was delayed by an average of 16.7 hours compared to controls (85.8 hours postpartum in the SRI-treated mothers and 69.1 h in the untreated mothers), which doubled the risk of delayed feeding behavior in the untreated group. However, the delay in lactogenesis II may not be clinically important, since there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the percentage of mothers experiencing feeding difficulties after day 4 postpartum.[22] A case control study compared the rate of predominant breastfeeding at 2 weeks postpartum in mothers who took an SSRI antidepressant throughout pregnancy and at delivery (n = 167) or an SSRI during pregnancy only (n = 117) to a control group of mothers who took no antidepressants (n = 182). Among the two groups who had taken an SSRI, 33 took citalopram, 18 took escitalopram, 63 took fluoxetine, 2 took fluvoxamine, 78 took paroxetine, and 87 took sertraline. Among the women who took an SSRI, the breastfeeding rate at 2 weeks postpartum was 27% to 33% lower than mother who did not take antidepressants, with no statistical difference in breastfeeding rates between the SSRI-exposed groups.[23]"

Maternal Levels: Three nursing women (time postpartum not stated) received a single oral dose of zopiclone 7.5 mg. Peak milk levels of about 55 mcg/L occurred about 2 hours after the dose. The half-life in milk was similar to that in plasma which was 5.3 hours in healthy adults.[2][3] Twelve nursing mothers who were 2 to 6 days postpartum were given a single oral dose of 7.5 mg of zopiclone. The peak milk level averaged 34 mcg/L (range 24 to 57 mcg/L) and it occurred 2.4 hours (range 1 to 6 hours) after the dose. The mean half-life in milk was 5.3 hours (range 3.5 to 8.6 hours). The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 15 mcg/kg or 1.2 to 1.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of zopiclone.[1] A woman took zopiclone 3.75 mg 4 times daily during pregnancy and postpartum for tension headaches. At 2 weeks postpartum, 2 hours after the second dose of the day, milk zopiclone levels ranged from 2.4 to 47.3 mcg/L and daily zopiclone excretion in the milk was estimated to be 3 mcg for a production of 335 mL. The weight-adjusted maternal dosage was estimated to be 3.2%.[4] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In 12 mothers who were 2 to 6 days postpartum  and took 7.5 mg of zopiclone, infant breastfeeding was interrupted for 8 to 10 hours before resuming. No unusual effect were noted in the infants.[1] Thirty-week preterm twins were born to a mother who took zopiclone 3.75 mg 4 times daily for tension headache during pregnancy. They developed withdrawal symptoms during the first week of life. Beginning at 2 weeks of age, they were about two-thirds breastfed by their mother who continued the drug at the same dose. The infants had no clinical abnormalities and were discharged from the hospital 6 weeks after birth.[4]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Average ethosuximide dosages of 50 to 60% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage are excreted in human milk and infant plasma levels of 25 to 30% of     Maternal Levels: are common. Although no adverse effects attributable solely to ethosuximide in breastmilk have been reported, monitor the infant for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of anticonvulsants. Measurement of an infant serum level might help rule out toxicity if there is a concern."
    drug_levels: "In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. An epileptic woman was taking primidone 250 mg and ethosuximide 500 mg orally every 12 hours. She did not nurse her infant, but had milk flow maintained to collect milk for study. Breastmilk ethosuximide levels were 55 to 70 mg/L on 4 occasions (times with respect to doses not stated) on days 3 to 5 postpartum.[1] Four ethosuximide breastmilk levels were measured between days 3 and 32 postpartum at unstated times after the dose in an unstated number of women who were taking ethosuximide and other anticonvulsants in unstated dosages. Ethosuximide milk levels averaged 21.3 mg/L (range 18 to 24 mg/L), while maternal serum levels averaged 29.3 mg/L.[2] An epileptic woman was taking oral ethosuximide 250 mg daily as a single agent during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Breastmilk samples were measured on several occasions during the first 4 months postpartum. Maternal serum and milk levels increased to higher levels between 1 and 2 months postpartum and then decreased, although the times of collection with respect to the doses were not reported. Milk levels on day 3 postpartum were about 31 mg/L, increased to about 55 mg/L at 1 month postpartum and decreased to about 42 mg/L at 4.5 months postpartum.[3] Breastmilk ethosuximide levels were measured 1 to 4 times in 5 mothers who were taking ethosuximide alone (1 woman) or with other anticonvulsants (4 women). Ethosuximide milk levels averaged 49.5 mg/L (range 27 to 68.5 mg/L).[4] Using the average of the reported milk levels and maternal doses reported, exclusively breastfed infants would receive an average of 62% (range 32 to 113%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Three women taking ethosuximide alone and one taking ethosuximide and phenytoin had colostrum levels that were 79 to 103% of maternal plasma levels; at 1.5 to 4.5 months postpartum, the average ratio was 1.[5] A mother taking ethosuximide 1 gram daily during pregnancy and postpartum had breastmilk levels measured during the first week postpartum. The breastmilk concentration was 36 mg/L which was 92% of the maternal serum concentration.[6] Two epileptic women who were taking ethosuximide had breastmilk samples measured. One mother who was taking ethosuximide 1 g daily plus carbamazepine 1.2 g daily had a breastmilk ethosuximide level of 33.9 mg/L at 2 weeks postpartum. The other mother taking ethosuximide monotherapy 750 mg daily had a milk level of 52.5 mg/L at 3.5 months postpartum.[7] Their infants would receive 35 and 57% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage if they were exclusively breastfed. Infant Levels: An exclusively breastfed infant whose mother was taking ethosuximide 250 mg daily began nursing (extent not stated) on day 2 postpartum and continued through 4.5 months of observation. Infant serum levels increased in parallel to maternal serum and breastmilk concentrations. The infant serum level was 22 mg/L on day 3 and reached a maximum of 29.5 mg/L at 1 month of age before decreasing to about 8.5 mg/L at 4.5 months of age. Intensive sampling of infant serum levels at 4 and 4.5 months of age found little fluctuation during the day and infant plasma levels were 24 to 30% of simultaneous maternal serum levels on the 2 days.[3] Three fully breastfed infants whose mothers were taking ethosuximide had plasma levels that were 24 to 75% of their mother's average plasma levels. A fourth infant who was mostly formula-fed had undetectable plasma levels.[5] The breastfed infant of a mother taking ethosuximide monotherapy 750 mg daily had a serum level of 16.9 mg/L which was 32% of the simultaneous maternal plasma level.[7]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "An infant whose mother was taking ethosuximide 250 mg daily began exclusive breastfeeding on day 2 postpartum and continued through 4.5 months of observation. The infant developed normally during this time and had no signs of an adverse reaction.[3] Sedation, poor sucking and poor weight gain during the first 4 weeks of life occurred in a breastfed newborn whose mother was taking ethosuximide.[4] The reaction was possibly caused by ethosuximide in breastmilk; however, the mother was also taking primidone and valproic acid. Three fully breastfed infants and a mostly formula-fed whose mothers were taking ethosuximide had no adverse reactions observed during the first 1.5 to 4.5 months of life.[5]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "When used epidurally or intravenously during labor or for a short time immediately postpartum, amounts of fentanyl ingested by the neonate are small and are not expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. No waiting period or discarding of milk is required before resuming breastfeeding after fentanyl is used for short procedures (e.g., for endoscopy).[1][2] After general anesthesia, breastfeeding can be resumed as soon as the mother has recovered sufficiently from anesthesia to nurse. When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. Limited information indicates that transdermal fentanyl in a dosage of 100 mcg/hour results in undetectable fentanyl concentrations in breastmilk.<br><br>  The results of studies on the effect of epidural fentanyl on breastfeeding initiation and duration are mixed and controversial, because of the many different combinations of drugs, dosages and patient populations studied as well as the variety of techniques used and deficient design of many of the studies. In infants placed skin-to-skin after a normal vaginal delivery, epidural fentanyl given during labor may delay the infant's first suckling in a dose-dependent manner.[3] However, it appears that with good breastfeeding support, epidural fentanyl plus bupivacaine has little overall effect on breastfeeding success.[4][5][6][7]<br><br>  Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of fentanyl to a few days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately."
    drug_levels: "Plasma fentanyl levels of 0.2 to 1.2 mcg/L are required for analgesia via the nonepidural route and plasma levels over 1 to 2 mcg/L may cause respiratory depression. Plasma levels are markedly lower when the epidural route is used. The oral bioavailability of fentanyl is 33% in adults. The usual intravenous of fentanyl for an infant is 1 to 2 mcg/kg. Fentanyl is metabolized to norfentanyl and inactive metabolites. Maternal Levels: Eight women who had undergone cesarean section received fentanyl 100 mcg epidurally immediately after delivery. Fentanyl was undetectable (  < 0.1 mcg/L) in colostrum at about 1 hour after the dose.[8] Thirteen women were given a single fentanyl 2 mcg/kg intravenous dose during either cesarean section or postpartum tubal ligation. Colostrum was collected at 0.75, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours after the dose. The average peak fentanyl level was 0.40 mcg/L and occurred 45 minutes after the dose. Average levels declined to 0.22 mcg/L at 2 hours and to 0.15 mcg/L at 4 hours then to the lower limit of the assay (0.05 mcg/L) at 6, 8, and 10 hours after the dose.[9] Based on the peak milk fentanyl level reported in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a fentanyl dose of 0.06 mcg/kg daily.Ten women were given 50 to 100 mcg of intravenous fentanyl every hour during labor. Their breastmilk was sampled 4 and 24 hours after delivery. The cumulative maternal fentanyl dosages ranged from 50 to 400 mcg and the longest time from last dose to delivery was 3.1 hours (range 0 to 3.1 hours). Fentanyl was undetectable (  < 0.05 mcg/L) in the milk of 8 of the women 4 hours after delivery and in 2 of the women 24 hours after delivery. Detectable milk levels of fentanyl ranged from 0.12 to 0.15 mcg/L at 4 hours after delivery and from 0.12 to 0.14 mcg/L at 24 hours after delivery.[10] Based on the highest milk level reported in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a fentanyl dosage of 0.02 mcg/kg daily. Five women who were 6 to 15 weeks postpartum were given a single dose of 100 mcg of fentanyl intravenously before undergoing general anesthesia. Several milk samples were collected between 5 and 24 hours after the injection from each woman. The authors estimated that the infants would receive an average of 0.005 mcg/kg in the 24 hours after a single dose of fentanyl. This corresponds to about 0.38 % of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. The women's milk output following the surgical procedure was less than half of the normal milk output of nursing mothers. The authors concluded that this amount of fentanyl in milk is unlikely to affect a healthy, term infant.[11] The infants of mothers not undergoing a surgical procedure might receive a greater dose of fentanyl in breastmilk, but it would be unlikely to be a large dose. A randomized, prospective study measured colostrum fentanyl concentrations following epidural or intravenous fentanyl during delivery in 100 multiparous mothers undergoing cesarean section and delivering fullterm, healthy infants. Epidural fentanyl was given to 50 women in a dose of 100 to 150 mcg in divided doses followed by a continuous epidural infusion of 20 mcg/hour. Intravenous fentanyl was given to 50 women as a single dose of 50 mcg after delivery. Both groups received epidural or spinal bupivacaine in addition. Colostrum samples were obtained 45 minutes and 24 hours after the initial fentanyl dose. At 45 minutes, colostrum fentanyl concentrations were 0.4 mcg/L in the epidural group and 0.19 mcg/L in the intravenous group. At 24 hours, colostrum fentanyl concentrations were 80 ng/L in the epidural group and 0.05 mcg/L in the intravenous group. The authors estimated that in the worst-case scenario, a fully breastfed infant would absorb a fentanyl dose of 0.016 mcg/kg.[12]A woman was using a transdermal fentanyl patch for chronic back pain during pregnancy and postpartum. The mother required additional analgesia during labor and the infant required treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome. By 2 weeks postpartum, the mother was using a fentanyl patch in a dosage of 100 mcg/hour which was changed every other day. A sample of pumped breastmilk from one breast contained fentanyl 6.4 mcg/L and norfentanyl 6.2 mcg/L.[13] Infant Levels: An infant whose mother was using a fentanyl patch in a dosage of 100 mcg/hour which was changed every other day was fed her mother's milk either by bottle or by the breast every 3 hours beginning about 2 weeks postpartum. On day 27 of life, the infant was fed 380 mL of maternal milk following several feedings during the prior 24 hours. The infant's serum fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations were not detectable (  < 0.1 mcg/L).[13]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Fentanyl was possibly the cause of statistically significant, but clinically unimportant, lower neurobehavioral scores in a group of 32 newborns who were less than 24 hours old and whose mothers had received epidural fentanyl during labor.[14] An epidural fentanyl dosage greater than 150 mcg during labor was associated with slightly lower neurobehavioral scores in the newborns of 177 breastfeeding mothers on postpartum day 1 compared to a lower total dosage or to no fentanyl;[15] however, this might have been a chance association[16] and was probably due to placental transfer of fentanyl prior to delivery and not from breastmilk after delivery. All women also received epidural bupivacaine. A woman was using a transdermal fentanyl patch for chronic back pain during pregnancy and postpartum. The mother required additional analgesia during labor and the infant required treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome. By 2 weeks postpartum, the mother was using a fentanyl patch in a dosage of 100 mcg/hour which was changed every other day and the infant was being fed the mother's milk every 3 hours. The infant had no additional medical problems and fed well until discharge after day 27 of life, gaining 500 g.[13]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Fentanyl can increase serum prolactin.[17][18] However, the prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In 58 breastfeeding mothers who received an epidural fentanyl dosage greater than 150 mcg during labor, 21% reported more difficulty in establishing breastfeeding at 24 hours after delivery compared to 10% of mothers who received to a lower dosage or to no fentanyl. There was no difference in breastfeeding difficulty noted between the groups 24 hours after delivery when the assessment was performed by a lactation consultant. Women in the high-dose group who could be contacted were more likely to discontinue breastfeeding by 6 weeks after delivery and there was a higher rate of breastfeeding discontinuation at 6 weeks among mothers who reported breastfeeding difficulty 24 hours after delivery.[15] A relatively high dropout rate from the study at 6 weeks clouds the results.[16] A retrospective study of a random sample of 425 mothers delivering in a maternity unit found a dose-related increased risk of bottle feeding at hospital discharge associated with fentanyl administered during labor.[19] A prospective cohort study compared women who received continuous epidural analgesia with fentanyl and either bupivacaine or ropivacaine during labor and delivery (n = 52) to women who received no analgesia (n = 63). The average total fentanyl dosage was 124 mcg and the average total infusion time from start to delivery was 219 minutes. The study found no differences between the groups in breastfeeding effectiveness or infant neurobehavioral status at 8 to 12 hours postpartum or the number exclusively or partially breastfeeding at 4 weeks postpartum.[20] A randomized, prospective study measured infant breastfeeding behavior following epidural or intravenous fentanyl during delivery in 100 multiparous mothers undergoing cesarean section and delivering fullterm, healthy infants. Epidural fentanyl was given to 50 women in a dose of 100 to 150 mcg in divided doses followed by a continuous epidural infusion of 20 mcg/hour. Intravenous fentanyl was given to 50 women as a single dose of 50 mcg after delivery. Both groups received epidural or spinal bupivacaine in addition. A slight difference was seen in breastfeeding behavior between the groups, with the infants in the intravenous fentanyl group performing slightly worse than those in the epidural group. However, all mothers were able to breastfeed their infants at 24 hours. None had severe breastfeeding problems; 10 women in the epidural group reported mild or moderate problems and 7 women in the intravenous group reported breastfeeding problems. Twenty mothers in the epidural group and 14 in the intravenous group used supplemental bottle feeding, with the difference not statistically significant.[12] A randomized, multicenter trial compared the initiation rate and duration of breastfeeding in women who received high-dose epidural bupivacaine alone, or one of two low-dose combinations of bupivacaine plus fentanyl. The average fentanyl dosages in the two groups were 97 and 151 mcg in the first stage of labor and 10 and 12 mcg of fentanyl during the second stage of labor, respectively, with great variability. A nonepidural matched control group was also compared. No differences in breastfeeding initiation rates or duration were found among the epidural and nonmedicated groups, but women in the nonepidural group who received systemic meperidine had a lower breastfeeding initiation rate than in the other groups.[21] A nonrandomized study in low-risk mother-infant pairs found that there was no difference overall in the amount of sucking by newborns, whether their mothers received bupivacaine plus fentanyl, or fentanyl alone by epidural infusion in various dosages, or received no analgesia for childbirth. In a subanalysis by sex and number of sucks, female infants were affected by high-dose bupivacaine and high-dose fentanyl, but male infant were not.[22] However, the imbalances of many factors between the study groups makes this study difficult to interpret. In a prospective cohort study, 87 multiparous women who received epidural bupivacaine and fentanyl for pain control during labor and vaginal delivery. A loading dose of 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 50-100 mcg. Epidural analgesia is maintained using 0.0625% bupivacaine and fentanyl 0.2 mcg/mL. The median dose of fentanyl received by the women was 151 mcg (range 30 to 570 mcg). The women completed questionnaires at 1 and 6 weeks postpartum regarding breastfeeding. Most women had prior experience with breastfeeding, support at home and ample time off from work. All women were breastfeeding at 1 week postpartum and 95.4% of women were breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum.[23] A nonrandomized study at one Italian hospital compared primaparous mothers undergoing vaginal delivery who received epidural analgesia (n = 64) to those who did not (n = 64). Mothers who requested the epidural analgesia received an initial dose of 100 mcg of fentanyl diluted to 10 mL with saline. After the initial fentanyl, doses of 15 to 20 mL of 0.1% ropivacaine were administered if needed. The only difference between the groups of mothers was a longer duration of labor among the treated mothers. The quality of infant nursing was equal between the 2 groups of infants on several measures; however, more infants in the treated group breastfed for less than 30 minutes at the first feeding.[24] A national survey of women and their infants from late pregnancy through 12 months postpartum compared the time of lactogenesis II in mothers who did and did not receive pain medication during labor. Categories of medication were spinal or epidural only, spinal or epidural plus another medication, and other pain medication only. Women who received medications from any of the categories had about twice the risk of having delayed lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) compared to women who received no labor pain medication.[25] A randomized study compared the effects of cesarean section using general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, or epidural anesthesia, to normal vaginal delivery on serum prolactin and oxytocin as well as time to initiation of lactation. General anesthesia was performed using propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg for induction, followed by sevoflurane and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg as needed. After delivery, patients in all groups received an infusion of oxytocin 30 international units in 1 L of saline, and 0.2 mg of methylergonovine if they were not hypertensive. Fentanyl 1 to 1.5 mcg/kg was administered after delivery to the general anesthesia group. Patients in the general anesthesia group (n = 21) had higher post-procedure prolactin levels and a longer mean time to lactation initiation (25 hours) than in the other groups (10.8 to 11.8 hours). Postpartum oxytocin levels in the nonmedicated vaginal delivery group were higher than in the general and spinal anesthesia groups.[26] A randomized, nonblinded study compared the use of intramuscular meperidine 100 mg to intranasal (mean dose 486 mcg) or subcutaneous (mean dose 300 mcg) fentanyl for labor analgesia. More women in the meperidine group had difficulty establishing lactation (79%) than in the intranasal (39%) or subcutaneous (44%) fentanyl groups. Mothers who received meperidine reported more sedation, had longer labors, and their infants were more likely to be admitted to the nursery.[27]"

Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. Four women who were taking gabapentin and were 12 to 21 days postpartum and a fifth who was 97 days postpartum had a single breastmilk sample measured just before nursing 10 to 15 hours after the previous evening's dose. Their average dosage of 1.5 grams daily (range 0.6 to 2.1 grams daily) and their average milk level was 4.5 mg/L (range 1.2 to 8.7 mg/L). The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive a dosage of 0.2 to 1.3 mg/kg daily at the minimum which is equivalent to 1.3 to 3.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[2] A follow-up publication by the same authors found a similar degree of gabapentin excretion into breastmilk in 8 breastmilk samples from 3 additional mothers.[3] A woman took gabapentin 600 mg 3 times daily (36.7 mg/kg daily) plus amitriptyline 2.5 mg daily for 6 weeks beginning in the first few days postpartum for chronic back pain. Eight milk samples (6 foremilk and 2 hindmilk) were obtained over 24 hours. Milk levels varied between about 5 and 7 mg/L. Using the average milk level, a fully breastfed infant would receive a dosage of 0.86 mg/kg daily or 2.34% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[4] Infant Levels: Three infants who were 2 to 3 weeks of age and one who was 14 weeks of age were breastfed during maternal use of gabapentin in an average daily dosages of 1575 mg (range 600 mg to 2.1 grams daily). Serum levels were measured after the morning nursing before the mothers' morning dose of gabapentin (10 to 15 hours after th prior evening's dose). One infant had an undetectable (  < 0.12 mg/L) serum level. The other 3 had an average serum level of 0.27 mg/L, which was below the level of accurate quantification for the assay method. The latter 3 infants' serum levels averaged 7.7% (range 4 to 12%) of their mothers' serum levels.[2] A follow-up publication by the same authors found that gabapentin was undetectable (  < 0.7 mg/L) in the plasma of 3 additional breastfed infants.[3] An infant whose mother was taking gabapentin 36.7 mg/kg daily breastfed her infant 6 to 7 times daily with some additional artificial feeding at night. At 1.6 months of age, the infant's plasma gabapentin concentration was 0.4 mg/L which was about 6% of the average maternal plasma concentration.[4]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Three infants who were 2 to 3 weeks of age and one who was 14 weeks of age were breastfed during maternal use of gabapentin in an average daily dosages of 1575 mg (range 600 mg to 2.1 grams daily). One infant's mother was also taking topiramate and lorazepam and another infant's mother was taking clonazepam. No adverse effects were noted in any of the infants.[2] A follow-up publication by the same authors found no adverse reactions among 3 additional breastfed infants whose mothers were taking gabapentin during pregnancy and lactation.[3] <   An exclusively breastfed 5-day-old infant whose mother was taking gabapentin 1.2 grams and levetiracetam 2.5 grams daily during pregnancy and lactation appeared healthy to the investigators throughout the 6- to 8-week study period.[5] An infant whose mother was taking gabapentin 36.7 mg/kg daily breastfed her infant 6 to 7 times daily for most of the first 1.6 months of life with some additional artificial feeding at night. The mother was also taking amitriptyline 2.5 mg daily. At 1.6 months of age, the infant was found to be healthy with a weight between the 10th and 25th percentiles, having been at the 50th percentile at birth. His age on the Denver developmental test was the same as his chronological age.[4]"

    drug_levels: "Hydrocodone is metabolized to 6 active metabolites, including hydromorphone. Maternal Levels: Two hospitalized mothers were taking hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination for pain and pumped their milk for their nonhospitalized infants. They donated samples of their pumped milk for analysis of hydrocodone. One mother had 17 milk hydrocodone levels measured over 4 days while taking first 10 mg and then 5 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate as needed, beginning on day 7 postpartum. Her milk hydrocodone levels ranged from 8.6 to 127.3 mcg/L. The second mother had 5 milk hydrocodone levels measured over 1.5 days while taking 5 mg doses of hydrocodone bitartrate. Her milk hydrocodone levels ranged from 5.2 to 47.2 mcg/L, beginning at day 16 postpartum. Their infants received an estimated 3.1 and 3.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosages, but the absolute hydrocodone dosages were 8.58 mcg/kg and 3.07 mcg/kg daily because of the differences in the dosages ingested by their mothers.[1] A study of 30 postpartum women taking a hydrocodone-containing product for postpartum pain measured hydrocodone and hydromorphone in breastmilk. Milk samples were collected after lactogenesis II was judged to have occurred, usually starting on the third postpartum day. Mean and median maternal dosages of hydrocodone base were 175 and 145 mcg/kg daily, respectively (range 44.3 to 423.2 mcg/kg daily). The mean and median milk hydrocodone concentrations were 25.9 and 14.2 mcg/L, respectively. Only 12 of the 30 women had hydromorphone detectable (  > 1 mcg/L) in their milk with a median milk hydromorphone concentration of 1.9 mcg/L. Mean and median infant daily dosages of hydrocodone were 3.9 and 2.1 mcg/kg, respectively, which were equal to 2.4 and 1.6% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage, respectively. Mean and median infant dosage of hydromorphone were 2.1 and 0.3 mcg/kg daily, respectively. Two women excreted much more hydromorphone into their milk than the others and might represent ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolizers. Taking the two narcotics' potencies into account, a fully breastfed neonate would receive a mean and median of 1.5 and 0.7% of the minimum infant therapeutic opiate dosage; however, neonates might be more susceptible to the opiates than the older infants on whom these dosages were based. The authors concluded that maternal dosages of hydrocodone bitartrate up to 30 to 35 mg daily are unlikely to adversely affect breastfed neonates, but that prolonged use of dosages over 40 mg daily should be avoided during breastfeeding.[2] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "The 18-day-old infant of a breastfeeding mother became groggy and \"slept for most of the day\" while the mother was taking 20 mg of oral hydrocodone combined with 1300 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours for painful nipple candidiasis and mastitis. The mother decreased her dose by one-half and the infant apparently no longer experienced grogginess or hypersomnolence.[3] The infant's symptoms were probably due to the maternal hydrocodone. A 5-week-old breastfed infant became cyanotic and required mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and intubation. The infant's urine was positive for opioids and the infant responded positively to naloxone; the level of consciousness improved over 2 days and extubation was accomplished. The infant's mother admitted to taking a hydrocodone-acetaminophen combination product and methadone that had been prescribed for migraine headache before she was breastfeeding.[4] The infant's symptoms were probably due to the maternal opiate use."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Breastfed infants whose mothers are taking lamotrigine have relatively high plasma lamotrigine levels, averaging 30 to 35% of maternal serum levels; infant plasma levels up to 50% of     Maternal Levels: have been reported. Neonates are particularly at risk for high plasma levels because their ability to metabolize the drug by glucuronidation is limited, plasma protein binding is relatively low, and maternal plasma and milk levels can rise dramatically in the immediate postpartum period if the dosage is not reduced to the prepregnancy dosage.[1][2] Mild thrombocytosis has been reported in some infants and withdrawal symptoms can occur if breastfeeding is abruptly discontinued. One case of severe apnea occurred in a breastfed 16-day-old whose mother was taking a high dose of the drug, and other cases of central nervous system depression have ben reported. Additionally, lamotrigine can cause rare, but potentially fatal skin reactions, although none has been reported in breastfed infants. Breastfeeding during lamotrigine monotherapy does not appear to adversely affect infant growth or development, and breastfed infants had slightly higher IQs and enhanced verbal abilities than nonbreastfed infants at 6 years of age in one study.[3] Combination therapy with sedating anticonvulsants or psychotropics may result in infant sedation or withdrawal reactions.<br><br>  If lamotrigine is required by the mother, it is not necessarily a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, because many infants have been breastfed without adverse reactions. However, breastfed infants should be carefully monitored for side effects such as apnea, rash, drowsiness or poor sucking, including measurement of serum levels to rule out toxicity if there is a concern. Monitoring of the platelet count and liver function may also be advisable. If an infant rash occurs, breastfeeding should be discontinued until the cause can be established."

Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. An epileptic woman took oral lamotrigine 300 mg daily throughout pregnancy and postpartum. After 6 weeks postpartum, the dosage was reduced to 200 mg daily. Breastmilk lamotrigine levels (time with respect to the doses not stated) on a dose of 300 mg daily ranged from 2.4 to 6.5 mg/L. After reducing the maternal dosage to 200 mg daily, the milk levels were 1.95 and 1.26 mg/L at days 64 and 92 postpartum, respectively.[4]A woman with epilepsy was taking lamotrigine at a dosage of 300 mg daily in the last half of pregnancy and postpartum. At 2 weeks postpartum, breastmilk samples taken before the morning dose, before and after nursing, were 5.6 and 5.7 mg/L, respectively.[5] Thirty-four women with 35 births had breastmilk lamotrigine levels monitored. Specific dosages and milk levels were not reported in the abstract, but the authors stated that they calculated that some of the infants received a mg/kg dosage that would be expected to produce therapeutic serum levels. However, infant serum levels were not reported.[6] Nine epileptic mothers with 10 pregnancies taking lamotrigine in daily dosages averaging 411 mg daily (range 100 to 800 mg daily) had their breastmilk lamotrigine levels monitored between days 13 and 18 postpartum before and after nursing. (One of the mothers had her first of 2 pregnancies reported previously in reference [4]) Three of the women were also taking other anticonvulsants that induce lamotrigine metabolism; one was taking valproic acid that inhibits lamotrigine metabolism. The average prenursing breastmilk level was 7.4 mg/L (range 1 to 8.2 mg/L), 11.8 hours after the previous dose. The average postnursing level was 5.6 mg/L (range 1 to 8.2 mg/L); one mother had taken a dose during nursing. The authors estimated that these exclusively breastfed infants would receive between 0.2 and 1 mg/kg daily or about 9% (range 2 to 20%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[1][7] Six nursing mothers who were taking lamotrigine in an average dosage of 6.3 mg/kg daily (range 1.75 to 12.5 mg/kg daily)collected milk over 1 to 2 dosage intervals. The mean infant daily dosage of lamotrigine in breastmilk was 0.45 mg/kg daily (range 0.1 to 0.75 mg/kg daily) which was 7.6% (range 5.7 to 9.9%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[8]A hospital laboratory evaluated all requests for lamotrigine concentration measurements. Mothers were taking between 50 to 500 mg of lamotrigine daily in the postpartum period. Milk concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 10.3 mg/L.[9] Twenty-four nursing mothers taking lamotrigine had serum and breastmilk concentrations measured on several occasions. The average lamotrigine dosage was 387 mg daily (range 50 to 800 mg daily) or 5.93 mg/kg daily (range 0.99 to 14.34 mg/kg daily). The average breastmilk concentration of all samples was 3.4 mg/L (range 0.5 to 11.8 mg/L). The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average dosage of 0.51 mg/kg daily which was equivalent to 9.2% (range 3.1 to 21.1%) of the maternal weight-adjusted maternal dosage. Among 16 women who donated multiple serial milk samples, the peak milk concentrations occurred about 3 hours after the dose and averaged 2.3 times the average minimum milk concentration.[10] Four women who were taking lamotrigine during pregnancy and postpartum had their milk analyzed for lamotrigine twice between 1 to 12 weeks postpartum. Maternal dosages ranged from 250 to 900 mg daily and milk concentrations ranged from 2.8 to 8 mg/L.[11] A mother was taking 875 mg of lamotrigine daily at term and her dose was slowly reduced by 25 mg/day at weekly intervals beginning 2 weeks postpartum. On day 22 postpartum with a dose of 600 mg daily, her milk lamotrigine level was 7.68 mg/L 13 hours after a dose and on day 25, it was 10.06 mg/L 3.5 hours after the same dose. From days 28 to 64 postpartum on doses of 525 to 575 mg/day, milk samples contained 7.02 to 8.71 mg/L of lamotrigine 12 to 14 hours after a dose. The authors estimated that the infant's daily dosage on day 22 was 1.15 mg/kg, equating to 13% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[12] A mother treated for epilepsy during pregnancy and breastfeeding had lamotrigine measured in several blood and milk samples during the first month postpartum. She was receiving 400 mg of lamotrigine daily which corresponded to a dose of 5.3 mg/kg daily at birth increasing to 6.5 mg/kg daily at 1 month due to postpartum weight loss. Milk lamotrigine levels ranged from 7.8 to 11.5 mg/L on 4 occasions during the first month.[13][14] Infant Levels: An infant was exclusively breastfed from day 2 of age during maternal treatment with lamotrigine 300 mg daily. Infant total serum level at 2 days of age was 2.8 mg/L (free drug 1.2 mg/L), reflecting transplacental passage. Serum levels taken periodically 2 to 3 hours after the morning dose and 1 to 2 hours after breastfeeding ranged from 1.7 to 2.7 mg/L (free drug 0.73 to 1 mg/L). After maternal dosage reduction to 200 mg daily and 50% formula supplementation, total serum levels on days 64 and 92 dropped to 1.54 and 0.75 mg/L (free drug 0.53 and 0.24 mg/L), respectively. Infant serum levels were undetectable (total   < 0.2 mg/L; free   < 0.1 mg/L) on days 144 and 145 with only one breastfeeding daily.[4] The 2-week old breastfed infant of a mother taking lamotrigine 300 mg daily had a level of 1.4 mg/L before the mother's morning dose.[5]The plasma levels of 10 breastfed infants of 9 mothers taking lamotrigine during pregnancy and postpartum were monitored after birth. Most were breastfed from day 1 or 2 of age. Their transplacentally acquired plasma levels which were similar to maternal plasma levels at birth, generally dropped slightly over the first 72 hours of life. Infant plasma levels 2 to 3 weeks postpartum averaged 1.7 mg/L (range 0.5 to 3.3 mg/L) before nursing about 11.8 hours after the previous maternal dose and 1.5 mg/L (range   < 0.5 to 2.5 mg/L) after nursing. Infant plasma levels averaged 30% (range 23 to 50%) of their mothers' plasma levels at that time.[1][7] Four infants of mothers taking lamotrigine monotherapy during pregnancy and lactation for partial seizures had their plasma levels monitored on day 10 of age (sampling time with respect to dose or nursing not reported). Maternal dosages were 200,400,750, and 800 mg and the respective infant's serum levels were   < 1, 1.8, 2, and 1.3 mg/L. Repeat levels in 2 infants at 2 months of age were 1.7 and 1.9 mg/L (previously 1.8 and 1.3 mg/L, respectively). Infant plasma levels ranged from 0 to 43% of maternal plasma levels at 10 days of age and 20 and 23% of     Maternal Levels:at 2 months when they were partially breastfed, each receiving formula for 2 or 3 feedings daily.[2] Six infants with a median age of 4.1 months (range 0.1 to 5.1 months) were breastfed during maternal use of lamotrigine in an average dosage of 6.3 mg/kg daily. Five were exclusively breastfed and one was about 50% breastfed. Single serum levels taken at various times after the maternal dose averaged 0.6 (range 0.3 to 0.9 mg/L) which averaged 18% (range 3 to 33%) of maternal serum levels.[8] A hospital laboratory evaluated all requests for lamotrigine concentration measurements. Mothers were taking between 50 to 500 mg of lamotrigine daily. Infant serum concentrations averaged 88% of their mothers' serum concentrations at delivery , and averaged 45 to 55% of their mothers' serum concentrations at 3, 7, 14 and 30 days after delivery, although the percentage of infants who were breastfed was not stated. Infants who were breastfed (extent not stated) had serum concentrations ranging from   < 0.1 to 12.7 mg/L.[9] Simultaneous infant and maternal serum lamotrigine concentrations were obtained from 12 mother-infant pairs during maternal use of lamotrigine. Total infant serum concentrations of lamotrigine averaged 18.3% of maternal serum concentrations, but unbound infant serum concentrations averaged 30.9% of     Maternal Levels: probably because the drug was less bound in the infants' serum. In 4 mother-infant pairs who had simultaneous serum sampling at delivery and again during the first 4 weeks postpartum, infant/maternal serum concentration ratios averaged 12.2 (total) and 6.2 (unbound) times higher at delivery than at the second sampling. These decreases indicate that exposure to lamotrigine during breastfeeding is much less than exposure during pregnancy.[10] Four breastfed infants (extent not stated), whose mothers were taking lamotrigine in dosages ranging from 250 to 900 mg daily, had serum lamotrigine concentrations measured twice after breastfeeding between 1 and 12 weeks postpartum. The median serum concentration in the infants was 2.2 mg/L (range 1.7 to 3.3 mg/L), which was 26% of the median maternal serum concentrations.[11]An infant was fully breastfed by a mother taking lamotrigine during pregnancy and postpartum. The infant had a serum concentration of 7.7 mg/L at 12 hours of life and 5.8 mg/L on day 3 of life while his mother was taking 875 mg daily of lamotrigine. On day 16, 4 hours after the maternal dose and 3 hours after breastfeeding, the infant's serum concentration was 4.9 mg/L with a maternal dose of 850 mg daily. Breastfeeding was terminated on day 17 because of an severe apneic episode in the infant; on day 22, the infant's serum concentration was 1.3 mg/L and on day 25 it was 0.5 mg/L.[12] A mother treated for epilepsy during pregnancy and breastfeeding was receiving 400 mg of lamotrigine daily which corresponded to a dose of 5.3 mg/kg daily at birth and increasing to 6.5 mg/kg daily at 1 month due to postpartum weight loss. Her breastfed (extent not stated) infant had a serum lamotrigine concentration of 13.6 mg/L at birth, 12.7 mg/L at 4 days of age and then stabilized between 6.7 to 6.9 mg/L from days 6 to 32 of age. The initial high levels were probably due to transplacental transmission. The later concentrations corresponded to 44 to 49% of the maternal serum concentrations.[13][14] The same authors reported on 21 women who were taking lamotrigine during pregnancy and lactation and their infants. At 6 to 10 days postpartum, the infants' serum lamotrigine concentrations ranged from 0% to 74% of maternal serum concentrations.[15] A computer simulation of 300 cases in which the mother was receiving 200 mg of lamotrigine daily estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive an average of 2 mg of lamotrigine daily and develop average serum concentration of 1 mg/L.[16] Three breastfed preterm infants whose mothers were taking lamotrigine 200 mg daily had serum lamotrigine levels measured. One infant whose mother was taking no other drugs, had undetectable serum lamotrigine. The other two infants were twins whose mother was taking other unspecified medications for bipolar disorder. They reportedly had serum levels \"within the therapeutic range\". Whether the infants were exposed prenatally was not stated.[17] Four mothers treated with lamotrigine for bipolar disorder in dosages of 100 to 300 mg daily  fully breastfed their infants. Infant and maternal serum samples were obtained between 1.5 and 5 weeks postpartum. The infant serum levels averaged 32.5% (range 18 to 46%) of the maternal serum levels.[18]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "One infant was exclusively breastfed from day 2 of life during maternal lamotrigine 300 mg daily, which was decreased at 6 weeks postpartum to 200 mg daily and 50% formula was introduced. Examinations every 4 weeks showed normal development and no evidence of mental retardation or neurologic deficits. An electroencephalogram at 4 weeks of age showed no signs of pathology.[4] A breastfed infant whose mother was taking lamotrigine 300 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum had no observable adverse effects up to 5 months of age.[5] The same authors reported 9 previously unreported infants who were breastfed during maternal lamotrigine therapy (dosage range 100 to 800 mg daily) with no adverse effects.[1][7] Thirty-five pregnancies in 34 mothers who were taking lamotrigine during pregnancy were monitored. An unstated fraction of them breastfed their infants. No adverse effects in infants were observed.[6] An exclusively breastfed infant whose mother was taking lamotrigine 200 mg and levetiracetam 2.5 g daily during pregnancy and lactation appeared healthy to the investigators throughout the 6- to 8-week study period.[19] The breastfed infant of a woman taking lamotrigine 300 mg daily developed normally during the first 4 months of life and no adverse effects were observed.[20]A 6-week-old infant developed apparent withdrawal symptoms after abrupt weaning by a mother who was taking lamotrigine 200 mg daily during late pregnancy and postpartum. Symptoms included loss of appetite, neuromotor hyperexcitability and irritability. Symptoms occurred 2 weeks after weaning and were completely alleviated within 48 hours after instituting lamotrigine 1 mg/kg daily in the infant. Neuromotor development of the infant normalized 1 month after discontinuing therapy.[21] The reaction is rated as probably caused by lamotrigine in breastmilk. Six infants with a median age of 4.1 months (range 0.1 to 5.1 months) were breastfed during maternal use of lamotrigine in an average dosage of 6.3 mg/kg daily. Five were exclusively breastfed and one was about 50% breastfed. No adverse effects were noted by the mothers or the attending pediatricians. A clinical pediatric assessment in 3 of the infants also revealed no adverse effects.[8]Thirty infants whose mothers were taking lamotrigine were followed during breastfeeding. None of the infants developed a rash. Among infants who were monitored by laboratory testing, no abnormalities in liver tests, electrolytes (n = 10) or hematocrits (n = 8) were noted. Elevated platelet counts were observed in 7 of 8 infants tested (average age 3.8 weeks, range 2 to 10 weeks), with no adverse clinical effects.[10] A mother was taking 875 mg of lamotrigine daily at term and her dose was slowly reduced by 25 mg/day at weekly intervals beginning 2 weeks postpartum. Her infant was fully breastfed and on day 16 postpartum while she was taking 850 mg daily, the infant experienced a severe apneic episode requiring cardiac compressions to maintain perfusion and was responsive only to painful stimuli. The infant's mother was taking a high dosage and had extensive drug excretion into breastmilk, and the infant's serum concentration was at the high end of the therapeutic range for children, but the fact that no adverse effects had occurred prior to day 16 could not be explained. Lamotrigine was assessed to be the probable causes of the apneic episode.[12] Three women with bipolar disorder breastfed their infants during pregnancy and breastfeeding. One took 50 mg daily at term and increased her dose to 200 mg within one month. She reportedly breastfed her infant exclusively for 12 months. An unrelated infant rash occurred at 4 months of age, but the infant's growth and development were normal at 18 months of age. Another woman took lamotrigine 250 mg daily while she breastfed (extent not stated) her infant for several weeks. The infant's growth and development were normal at 18 months of age. The third mother also took 250 mg daily while breastfeeding (extent not stated) for at least 15 months. At 4 months of age, the infant developed a rash on the neck that resolved spontaneously; the infant's growth and development were normal at 15 months of age.[22] Five breastfed preterm infants were reported whose mothers were taking lamotrigine. Transient elevation of liver enzymes occurred in twins whose mother was taking other unspecified medications for bipolar disorder. No adverse effects were seen in the other infants.[17] A prospective cohort study in Norway followed infants of mothers who took antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and lactation and compared to infants with mothers with untreated epilepsy and infants with fathers who took antiepileptics as control groups. Of the 223 mothers studied, 71 were taking lamotrigine monotherapy. Infants were assessed at 6, 18 and 36 months of age. Continuous breastfeeding in children of women using antiepileptic drugs was associated with no greater impaired development than those with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for less than 6 months.[23][24] In a long-term study on infants exposed to anticonvulsants during breastfeeding, no difference in average intelligence quotient at 3 years of age was found between infants who were breastfed (n = 30) a median of 6 months and those not breastfed (n = 36) when their mothers were taking lamotrigine.[25] Breastfeeding during phenytoin monotherapy does not appear to adversely affect infant growth or development, and breastfed infants had higher IQs and enhanced verbal abilities than nonbreastfed infants at 6 years of age in one study.[3] Combination therapy with sedating anticonvulsants or psychotropics may result in infant sedation or withdrawal reactions. All adverse reactions in breastfed infants reported in France between January 1985 and June 2011 were compiled by a French pharmacovigilance center. Of 174 reports, lamotrigine was reported to cause adverse reactions in 6 infants and to be one of the drugs most often suspected in serious adverse reactions, such as sedation, hypotonia, weight loss and liver damage.[26]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Maternal doses of levetiracetam up to 3500 mg daily produce low levels in milk and would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants, especially if the infant is older than 2 months. If levetiracetam is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. However, the infant should be monitored for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of anticonvulsants. Maternal serum level monitoring and dosage adjustment is advisable in the early postpartum period if the drug was taken throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding.[1] Some evidence suggests that levetiracetam might reduce the maternal breastmilk supply in some women."
    drug_levels: "In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. A woman who was taking phenytoin, valproic acid and an unspecified dosage of levetiracetam had a milk levetiracetam level of 16.9 mg/L 3 hours after a dose, which was 3.1 times her simultaneous serum level.[2] Breastmilk levels in 12 mothers who were monitored at 4 days and 2 to 3 months postpartum were \"significantly lower\" than maternal blood levels. Further details were not published in the abstract.[3] Seven women taking an average of 2430 mg daily (range 1500 to 3500 mg daily) of levetiracetam plus various other anticonvulsants for epilepsy at the time of delivery had foremilk levels measured 3 to 5 days postpartum. Average milk levels were 12.5 mg/L (range 4.8 to 26 mg/L). Milk levels were again measured in 5 of the women plus another woman at one or more of the following times: 2, 4, 6 to 8 weeks and 4 or 10 months postpartum. Specific milk levels were not reported at those times, but the milk to plasma ratio was very similar at those times to the values at 3 to 5 days postpartum.[4] Eleven mothers who were 4 to 23 days postpartum and taking levetiracetam provided milk samples before nursing. Three women taking 100 mg daily had an average milk levetiracetam concentration of 8.68 mg/L (range 5.79 to 10.55 mg/L); 2 women taking 2000 mg daily had milk levels of 11.7 and 35.7 mg/L; 4 women taking 2500 mg daily had an average milk levetiracetam concentration of 13.95 mg/L (range 10 to 20.4 mg/L); and 2 women taking 3000 mg daily had milk concentrations of 17.4 and 29.1 mg/L. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive 7.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[5]A pregnant woman was treated with levetiracetam 1000 mg and lacosamide 100 mg twice daily as well as enoxaparin and labetalol for the rest of her pregnancy and postpartum. Levetiracetam was undetectable (  < 3 mg/L) in a milk sample on day 5 postpartum (exact time not specified).[6] Infant Levels: An infant (aged approximately 1 to 2 weeks) of a mother taking phenytoin, valproic acid and levetiracetam (dosage unspecified) had a serum levetiracetam level of 1 mg/L 96 hours after the mother discontinued breastfeeding.[2] Seven breastfed infants whose mothers were taking an average dosage of 2430 mg daily (range 1500 to 3500 mg daily) of levetiracetam plus various other anticonvulsants during pregnancy and lactation had serum levetiracetam measured before the mother's morning dose at 3 to 5 days of age. In 6 infants, levetiracetam was undetectable (  < 1.7 mg/L), although one of them had a serum level of 13 mg/L at the age of 1 day. A seventh infant who was fully breastfed had a serum level of 2.5 mg/L at 3 to 5 days of age. This infant and had serum levels ranging from 2.5 to 2.9 mg/L during the first 8 weeks of life and an undetectable serum level at 4 months of age.[4] Ten infants who were 4 to 23 days old were breastfed by mothers taking levetiracetam in dosages of 1000 to 3000 mg daily. Infant plasma levels were obtained 30 to 120 minutes after nursing and before their mother's morning dose (10 to 15 hours after the last evening dose), except for one infant whose plasma was sampled before nursing. The average levetiracetam plasma concentration was 1.9 mg/L (range 0.7 to 3.4 mg/L). The infants' plasma levels averaged 13.5% of the maternal plasma concentration taken before their morning dose. The authors found that 13 newborns' levetiracetam elimination half-life averaged 18 hours, which is 2 to 3 times that of adults.[5] The 10-day-old breastfed (extent not stated) infant of a mother who was taking levetiracetam 3000 mg daily had a serum concentration of 2.1 mg/L, which was less than half of the low end of the therapeutic range. Timing of the sample was not stated.[7] A pregnant woman was treated with levetiracetam 1000 mg and lacosamide 100 mg twice daily as well as enoxaparin and labetalol for the rest of her pregnancy and postpartum. Her infant was delivered at 36 weeks gestation and about 50% breastfed for the first 15 days of life. The infant had a cord blood levetiracetam concentration of 23 mg/L at birth and an undetectable (  < 3 mg/L) levetiracetam blood level on day 8 of age.[6]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "An epileptic woman took phenytoin and valproic acid during pregnancy. She began breastfeeding on day 3 postpartum and had a seizure on day 7 postpartum. Levetiracetam (dosage not reported) was started and the infant became increasingly hypotonic and nursed poorly. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the infant was discharged from the hospital in a healthy condition.[2] Seven exclusively breastfed infants whose mothers were taking an average dosage of 2430 mg daily (range 1500 to 3500 mg daily) of levetiracetam plus various other anticonvulsants during pregnancy and lactation appeared healthy to the investigators throughout the 6 to 8 week study period. An eighth partially breastfed infant whose mother was taking valproate and oxcarbazepine started taking levetiracetam 9 months postpartum appeared healthy at 10 months of age.[4]No adverse effects were reported in 10 newborns who were 4 to 23 days old who were breastfed during maternal intake of levetiracetam 1000 to 3000 mg daily. Four mothers were also taking lamotrigine; 1 was taking carbamazepine; and one was taking tiagabine, clobazam and oxcarbazepine.[5] A woman with long-standing seizure disorder was taking primidone and levetiracetam became pregnant. The dosage of her medications were reduced during pregnancy to provide a levetiracetam serum concentration of 40.5 mg/L and a primidone (phenobarbital) serum concentration of 3.4 mg/L. The mother was instructed to discontinue breastfeeding after 3 days. The following day her infant developed withdrawal seizures. After reinstituting breastfeeding, the infant's seizures stopped and did not recur. The infant had no abnormal findings and was thriving and seizure free at 6 months of age.[8]The infants (including 3 preterm) of 18 nursing mothers who were taking levetiracetam and called the Pharmacovigilance Center in Lyon, France before breastfeeding were paired with 18 control infants. The median dosage was 1000 mg daily (range 500 to 3000 mg daily) and 8 were receiving at least one additional anticonvulsant. The median duration of breastfeeding was 40 days (range 10 to 224 days), and 13 newborns were exclusively breastfed. Breastfed infants were followed for a median of 9.1 months (range 0.75 to 73 months). One 25-day-old infant whose mother was taking levetiracetam 3000 mg daily plus clobazam was hospitalized for sedation, vomiting, and weight loss, and improved rapidly after breastfeeding discontinuation. Another infant exposed to levetiracetam and clobazam had poor weight gain, but it appeared to be caused by poor milk production. Other than these infants, all levetiracetam and control infants grew and developed normally.[7] A pregnant woman suffered blood clots in the sinuses and 2 small intracranial hemorrhages followed by status epilepticus at 8 weeks of gestation. She was treated with levetiracetam 1000 mg and lacosamide 100 mg twice daily as well as enoxaparin and labetalol for the rest of her pregnancy and postpartum. Her infant was delivered at 36 weeks gestation and about 50% breastfed for the first days of life. The infant was sleepy and fed poorly, but pauses in breastfeeding did not improve the infant's condition. Breastfeeding was discontinued at 15 days postpartum and the infant gradually improved. The infant showed normal development at 7 months of age.[6]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "In a study of mothers taking levetiracetam during breastfeeding, 7 of 18 mothers discontinued or reduced breastfeeding because of poor milk output. The infant of one mother taking 3000 mg of levetiracetam daily plus clobazam had poor weight gain at day 15 of life.[7]"

After 7 hours the infusion was stopped a milk sample was provided. The breastmilk contained 800 mcg/L of lidocaine; metabolites were not measured.[1] A woman received 20 mg of lidocaine with 5 mg of epinephrine (2 mL of a 2% lidocaine with 0.5% epinephrine) injected for a dental procedure 3 days postpartum. Milk levels 2 hours after the injection were 66 mcg/L of lidocaine and 35 mcg/L of its MEGX metabolite. At 6.5 hours after the dose, the levels were 44 mcg/L and 41 mcg/L, respectively.[4] Twenty-two women received epidural lidocaine 2% and bupivacaine 0.5% for pain control during cesarean delivery. Lidocaine dosage averaged 183 mg (range 60 to 500 mg). Average milk lidocaine concentrations were 860 mcg/L at 2 hours after delivery, 460 mcg/L at 4 hours after delivery and 220 mcg/L at 12 hours after delivery.[2] A woman undergoing tumescent liposuction received 4.2 g of lidocaine into her fat. Seventeen hours after the procedure, a milk lidocaine level was 550 mcg/L. It was previously shown that maximum serum lidocaine concentrations occur at about this time.[3] Six women were given 3.6 mL of lidocaine 2% without epinephrine and a seventh received lidocaine 2% without epinephrine 4.5 mL and 7.2 mL on 2 separate occasions for dental procedures. Milk lidocaine concentrations averaged 120.5 mcg/L at 3 hours after the dose and 58.3 mcg/L 6 hours after the dose. Milk MEGX levels were 97.5 and 52.7 mcg/L at 3 and 6 hours after the dose, respectively.[5] Using the average daily intake reported in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of lidocaine and another 0.8% in the form of the metabolite MEGX.

One group received the lidocaine before incision, one group received the lidocaine after the incision, and the third received 10 mL before the incision and 10 mL after. Women in the pre-and post-incision administration group initiated breastfeeding earlier than those in the pre-incision administration (3.4 vs 4.1 hours). There was no difference between the post-incision administration group and the other groups in time to breastfeeding initiation.[6] A national survey of women and their infants from late pregnancy through 12 months postpartum compared the time of lactogenesis II in mothers who did and did not receive pain medication during labor. Categories of medication were spinal or epidural only, spinal or epidural plus another medication, and other pain medication only. Women who received medications from any of the categories had about twice the risk of having delayed lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) compared to women who received no labor pain medication.[7]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Intravenous meperidine during labor can interfere with nursing and maternal use of meperidine during breastfeeding can sedate the infants. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia postpartum appears to be free from these effects. However, other agents, such as fentanyl, are preferred for intravenous or intramuscular use, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.[1] Labor pain medication may delay the onset of lactation.<br><br>  A single dose for anesthesia or conscious sedation usually does not cause problems in older breastfed infants.[2][3] When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. Maternal use of oral narcotics during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, central nervous system depression and even death. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of meperidine to a few days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately. Other agents are preferred over meperidine during breastfeeding.[4]"
    drug_levels: "Meperidine is metabolized to the inactive meperidinic acid and to the active metabolite normeperidine which has half the analgesic activity and at least twice the central nervous system excitatory activity of meperidine. The oral bioavailability of meperidine is about 50% in adults. Newborns have impaired meperidine metabolism and possibly a higher oral bioavailability than adults.[5] Newborns may also experience more central nervous system depression from normeperidine than adults. The usual infant oral meperidine dose is 1 to 2 mg/kg while the usual intravenous dose is 1 mg/kg which results in neonatal plasma levels of about 200 to 500 mcg/L.[6] Maternal Levels: In 9 mothers who were 3 to 7 days postpartum and had received a single 50 mg intramuscular dose of meperidine, the highest measured breastmilk level was 130 mcg/L and occurred 2 hours after the dose.[7] Using the peak meperidine milk level from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 20 mcg/kg daily of meperidine. However, normeperidine was not measured in the study. Two breastfeeding mothers who were 8 to 72 hours postpartum and receiving about 500 mg daily of intravenous meperidine had their milk sampled 2 to 4 times over 48 to 72 hours. Relationships between dose timing and milk sampling were not stated. The reported range of measured meperidine milk levels were 165 to 311 mcg/L. Measured normeperidine milk levels were undetectable (  < 1.6 mcg/L) during the first 12 hours postpartum in 1 patient and reached only 66 mcg/L during the same period in the other patient. In the 36 to 72 hour postpartum period, the reported range of measured normeperidine milk levels were 151 to 333 mcg/L.[8] Using the peak meperidine milk level from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 50 mcg/kg daily of meperidine from a maternal intravenous meperidine regimen of 500 mg per day, equal to about 6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Using the peak normeperidine milk level from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an additional 50 mcg/kg daily of normeperidine.Five mothers who had undergone cesarean section delivery at term were given intravenous meperidine 75 mg after umbilical cord clamping and then 12.5 mg every 6 minutes via intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) as needed for up to 20 to 48 hours postpartum. When PCA meperidine was discontinued, oral meperidine 50 to 300 mg every 2 to 3 hours as needed was given. Colostrum and milk were sampled from each of the mothers 6 times over 96 hours beginning at 12 hours postpartum. Each mother's individual milk level and meperidine dose were not reported. Two mothers were able to provide enough milk in the 12 to 24 hour postpartum period, 3 were able in the 36 to 48 hour period and 4 were able in the 72 to 96 hour period. The average peak meperidine milk level was about 1100 mcg/L at 12 hours then 450, 250, 200, 150, 100 mcg/L at 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 hours postpartum, respectively. Milk levels declined while the daily dose of intravenous meperidine in the first 36 hours postpartum remained nearly the same. The average individual cumulative intravenous meperidine dose in the first 12 hours postpartum when the peak milk level occurred was about 350 mg. The cumulative dose in the first 36 hours during mostly intravenous maternal meperidine was about 850 mg. The average cumulative oral meperidine dose over the 48 to 96 hour postpartum period was about 300 mg. The average cumulative intravenous plus oral meperidine dose over the entire 96 hours was about 1300 mg.[9] Using the peak milk level reported in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 165 mcg/kg daily of meperidine. Using the average milk levels during the first 36 hours postpartum when intravenous dosing predominated and was steady at about 25 mg per hour, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 56 mcg/kg daily, equal to 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Using all the average milk levels reported over 96 hours postpartum an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 36 mcg/kg daily, also equal to 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. However, normeperidine was not measured in the study.Eight breastfeeding women who were 1 month to 1 year postpartum and undergoing gynecological surgery had their milk sampled 3 times after a single intraoperative dose of intravenous meperidine. Seven of the women received 25 mg. Individual meperidine milk levels were not reported. Their average meperidine milk level was 176 mcg/L at 1 to 3 hours after the dose (range 134 to 244 mcg/L in 5 women 1 to 2 hours after the dose and 76 to 318 mcg/L in 3 women 2 to 3 hours after the dose). Only 3 of the women had detectable (  > 20 mcg/L) meperidine milk levels at 8 to 10 hours after the dose (range 76 to 318 mcg/L). One woman received 75 mg meperidine. Her milk level was 571 mcg/L 4 hours after the dose and 224 mcg/L 8 hours after the dose. None had detectable levels (  > 20 mcg/L) 24 to 28 hours after their dose. The authors determined that infants in this study received 1.2 to 3.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[10] Twenty women who had a cesarean section delivery were receiving patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with meperidine for postpartum analgesia. They received aa mean meperidine dose of 15.9 mg/hour (range 3.7 to 35.2 mg/hour) and a median total dose of 4.5 mg/kg daily (range 1.1 to 7.6 mg/kg daily) during the first 35 to 46 hours postpartum. Breastmilk samples were taken within 2 hours of the end of PCEA and 6 hours later, if possible. Mean meperidine milk concentrations was 421 mcg/L in the first sample and 176 mcg/L in the second. Mean normeperidine milk concentrations was 414  mcg/L in the first sample and 373 mcg/L in the second sample. Absolute infant dosages of meperidine were 20 mcg/kg daily at the time of the first sample and 10 mcg/kg daily at the time of the second. Absolute infant dosages of normeperidine were 21 mcg/kg daily at the time of the first sample and 22 mcg/kg daily at the time of the second. The authors estimated that the combined weight-adjusted maternal dosages of meperidine plus normeperidine was 1.4% and 0.9% for the first milk sample and second sample, respectively.[11] Infant Levels: Six breastfed and 6 bottle-fed newborns had meperidine saliva levels measured 2 to 3 hours of age before their first feeding, then again at 24 and 48 hours of age, both times 1.5 hours after a feeding. Their mothers had received a single dose of 100 mg intramuscular meperidine 3 to 4 hours prior to delivery. Meperidine saliva levels in the breastfed newborns were higher at 24 hours of age than at 2 to 3 hours of age. They then decreased slightly by 48 hours of age to levels that were still higher than at 2 to 3 hours of age. In contrast, meperidine saliva levels in the newborns that were bottle-fed decreased over the first 48 hours postpartum. Meperidine was eliminated from saliva very slowly by both groups of newborns. The authors surmised that the higher saliva meperidine levels in the breastfed newborns was caused by oral absorption of meperidine from breastmilk.[10] Twenty breastfed (extent not stated) infants whose mothers had received patient-controlled epidural analgesia with meperidine had blood samples obtained 48 to 72 hours postpartum at about the time the maternal meperidine was discontinued. Samples were available from 17 infants and averaged 3 mcg/L for meperidine and 0.6 mcg/L of normeperidine. Compared with maternal plasma concentrations obtained at about the same time, infant meperidine and normeperidine concentrations were 1.4 and 0.4% of     Maternal Levels:[11]"

They were assessed with the Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Score (NACS) at a median of 105 minutes after maternal meperidine cessation. The median NACS was 33.5 (range 24 to 38), which is similar to the average score of 35 in healthy infants with no drug effects.[11]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Meperidine can increase serum prolactin.[13] However, the prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. More importantly, meperidine is likely to interfere with infant nursing behavior when given during labor.[14][15][16] In one small study, women given promethazine with meperidine and secobarbital during labor, had the time to lactogenesis II prolonged by 14 hours. Women given meperidine or secobarbital without promethazine had  lactogenesis II prolonged 7 hours compared to unmedicated women, but the difference was not statistically significant.[17] A randomized, multicenter trial compared the initiation rate and duration of breastfeeding in  women who received high-dose epidural bupivacaine alone, or one of two low-dose combinations of bupivacaine plus fentanyl. A nonepidural matched control group, some of whom received systemic meperidine, was also compared. Women in the nonepidural group who received systemic meperidine had a lower breastfeeding initiation rate than in the epidural or unmedicated groups.[18] A national survey of women and their infants from late pregnancy through 12 months postpartum compared the time of lactogenesis II in mothers who did and did not receive pain medication during labor. Categories of medication were spinal or epidural only, spinal or epidural plus another medication, and other pain medication only. Women who received medications from any of the categories had about twice the risk of having delayed lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) compared to women who received no labor pain medication.[19] A randomized, nonblinded study compared the use of intramuscular meperidine 100 mg to intranasal (mean dose 486 mcg) or subcutaneous (mean dose 300 mcg) fentanyl for labor analgesia. More women in the meperidine group had difficulty establishing lactation (79%) than in the intranasal (39%) or subcutaneous (44%) fentanyl groups. Mothers who received meperidine reported more sedation, had longer labors, and their infants were more likely to be admitted to the nursery.[20] Analysis of an Australian database of 1835 pregnant women found that the 285 women who received meperidine during labor were 41% more likely to have discontinued breastfeeding by 6 weeks of age.[21]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Most infants receive an estimated dose of methadone ranging from 1 to 3% of the mother's weight-adjusted methadone dosage with a few receiving 5 to 6%, which is less than the dosage used for treating neonatal abstinence. Initiation of methadone postpartum, or increasing the maternal dosage to greater than 100 mg daily therapeutically or by abuse while breastfeeding poses a risk of sedation and respiratory depression in the breastfed infant, especially if the infant was not expose to methadone in utero. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately. Other agents are preferred over methadone for pain control during breastfeeding.<br><br>  Women who received methadone maintenance during pregnancy and are stable should be encouraged to breastfeed their infants postpartum, unless there is another contraindication, such as use of street drugs.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Breastfeeding may decrease, but not eliminate, neonatal withdrawal symptoms in infants who were exposed in utero. Some studies have found shorter hospital stays,[8][9] shorter durations of neonatal abstinence therapy and shorter durations of therapy among breastfed infants,[10] although the dosage of opiates used for neonatal abstinence may not be reduced.[11][12][13] Abrupt weaning of breastfed infants of women on methadone maintenance might result in precipitation of or an increase in infant withdrawal symptoms, and gradual weaning is advised. The breastfeeding rate among mothers taking methadone for opiate addiction has been lower than in mothers not using methadone in some studies, but this finding appears to vary by institution, indicating that other factors may be important."
    drug_levels: "Methadone is metabolized to inactive pyrrolidine and pyrroline metabolites. In adults, methadone oral bioavailability is 80 to 95%.[14] In newborns of opiate-dependent mothers, methadone is used to treat neonatal abstinence syndrome. The usual infant dose is 50 to 100 mcg/kg given every 6 to 12 hours.[15] Maternal Levels: One mother taking 50 mg daily of oral methadone maintenance had milk sampled several times on postpartum days 4 through 8. The highest methadone breastmilk levels (100 and 120 mcg/L) were measured 4 hours after a dose. At 6 and 15 hours after a dose, the level was 40 mcg/L. Lower milk levels (20 and 30 mcg/L) were measured 0 to 3 hours after a dose.[16] Using the peak milk level from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 18 mcg/kg daily, equal to about 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Ten mothers who were 3 to 10 days postpartum and taking oral methadone maintenance 10 to 80 mg once daily had single milk samples that contained methadone levels ranging from 50 to 570 mcg/L.[17] Using the peak level from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a maximum of 86 mcg/kg daily of methadone, equal to about 6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. One mother taking 25 mg daily of oral methadone maintenance had breastmilk sampled twice on postpartum days 5 and 6. The peak methadone milk level was 700 mcg/L on day 5 and 600 mcg/L on day 6, both occurring 3 hours after the dose. Trough levels were about 15 mcg/L on both days.[18] Two postpartum mothers taking oral methadone maintenance, one 73 mg once daily and the other 30 mg twice daily, had serial milk levels sampled on day 11 and 14 postpartum, respectively. Milk levels ranged from 110 to 180 mcg/L in the first mother and 110 to 250 mcg/L in the second.[19] One lactating mother taking oral methadone maintenance 45 mg daily had milk sampled several times over the first 4 weeks postpartum and again several times over 24 hours at 6 weeks postpartum. Her colostrum methadone level was 77 mcg/L on the day of delivery and milk levels remained fairly constant (range 77 to 123 mcg/L) throughout the study period. There was little difference in milk levels before and after feeding. Peak milk levels occurred 4 to 6 hours after a dose.[20] Using the range of milk levels reported in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a maximum of about 12 to 18 mcg/kg daily, equal to 1.6 to 2.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Two mothers, one at 1 week and the other at 3 weeks postpartum, taking oral methadone maintenance (average 0.5 mg/kg daily), had milk levels sampled 4 to 6 times over 8 to 10 hours after a dose. Peak levels were 30 mcg/L and 70 mcg/L, and occurred 1 and 2 hours after the dose, respectively. The half-life of methadone elimination from milk over the collection period was about 8 to 10 hours in both mothers.[21] Using the milk levels reported in this study, calculated average milk levels are about 21 mcg/L and 58 mcg/L, respectively. Using these calculated average milk levels, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 3 to 8 mcg/kg daily of methadone, equal to 0.6 to 1.6 % of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Twelve breastfeeding mothers, 11 of whom were 3 to 7 days postpartum and 1 who was 26 days postpartum, were taking daily oral methadone maintenance (range 20 to 80 mg daily) and had their milk sampled once before and once after breastfeeding their infants. Milk sampling occurred 2 to 4 hours after a methadone dose. Levels after the feeding tended to be higher than those before. Milk levels tended to be higher with higher maternal doses. The reported average milk level from all 12 mothers was 116 mcg/L (range 39 to 232 mcg/L). Using this average milk level, the authors calculated an average infant dose from breastmilk of 17.4 mcg/kg daily (range 5.9 to 34.8 mcg/kg daily) and an average maternal weight-adjusted dosage of 2.8% (range 1.4 to 5.1%).[22] Eight breastfeeding mothers who were 3 weeks to 6 months postpartum and taking an average daily dosage of 102 mg of oral methadone maintenance (range 25 to 180 mg) divided twice daily during pregnancy and lactation had their milk sampled 1 to 3 times at 1 to 8 hours after a dose. The reported average milk level of all the samples from all the mothers in this study was 95 mcg/L (range 27 to 260 mcg/L). Milk levels were reportedly not related to methadone dose, but the exact timing of maternal dose and milk levels was not reported. The maximum level reported in this study occurred in a mother taking 55 mg twice daily at 110 days postpartum.[23] Using the maximum milk level reported in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 39 mcg/kg daily, equal to about 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Nine breastfeeding mothers taking 22 to 230 mg of daily oral methadone maintenance had their milk sampled prior to their daily dose and at several times 1 to 23 hours after the dose. Peak levels appeared to occur 2 hours after the dose. A calculated maximum infant intake of 200 mcg/kg daily was reported. The age of the infants, the individual maternal methadone doses and methadone milk levels were not reported.[24] Eight breastfeeding mothers who were 1 to 11 days postpartum and taking 40 to 105 mg of oral methadone maintenance once daily during pregnancy and lactation had their milk sampled 6 times over 24 hours after a dose. Average milk levels in each mother were calculated from their multiple samples. The average milk level of all 8 mothers was 237 mcg/L (range 68 to 385 mcg/L). Using each of the mother's average milk level, the authors calculated an average maternal weight-adjusted dosage of 2.8%. Two of these mothers had repeat milk sampling at 18 and 27 days postpartum. Each was taking 75 mg daily of methadone. Their average milk levels were 254 and 165 mcg/L with an average maternal weight-adjusted dosage of 2.35 and 1.75%, respectively.[25] Twelve mothers who were taking oral methadone maintenance during pregnancy and postpartum had their milk tested. Each mother collected pre- and post-feed samples by pump or hand expression just before and 3 hours after the daily methadone dose for each of the first 4 days postpartum. Their average methadone dose at delivery was 76 mg daily (range 40 to 100 mg daily). Average pre-feed trough milk levels ranged from 76 to 102 mcg/L; average post-feed trough levels ranged from 65 to 115 mcg/L. Average pre-feed peak milk levels ranged from 128 to 166 mcg/L; average post-feed peak levels ranged from 123 to 200 mcg/L. No relationship was found between maternal dose and milk levels. The authors calculated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive the following average doses of methadone: 0.006 mg on day 1 postpartum, 0.018 mg on day 2 postpartum, 0.039 mg on day 3 postpartum and 0.084 mg on day 4 postpartum.[26] In a further analysis, 4 women were followed for 90 to 120 days postpartum. No increase in milk concentrations or infant dosage were noted over time, with an average infant intake calculated to be less than 0.33 mg daily.[27] Three women were taking methadone for narcotic abstinence in doses of 70, 40 and 30 mg daily. Methadone milk concentrations measured before and 4 hours after the doses were in the range of 32 to 146 mcg/L with much lower amounts of the two major methadone metabolites, EDDP and EMDP.[28] Twenty women who were taking methadone in daily dosages averaging 102 mg (range 40 to 200 mg) had methadone measured in milk samples 1 to 6 days postpartum; 16 of the 20 samples were taken between 1 and 4 hours after a dose at the approximate time of peak milk levels. The authors estimated that the maximum amount that a fully breastfed infant would receive is 20 mcg/kg daily (range 4 to 99) of R-methadone and 13 mcg/kg daily (range 2 to 71) of S-methadone in breastmilk. These amounts were 2.7% and 1.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosages of the 2 isomers.[29] Infant Levels: The 4-week-old infant of a breastfeeding mother taking 45 mg of oral methadone maintenance a day had undetectable (  < 0.3 mcg/L) serum levels throughout the first 4 weeks of life.[20] Eight 3- to 7-day-old term infants of mothers taking daily oral methadone maintenance (range 20 to 80 mg daily) had their blood drawn shortly after breastfeeding. Methadone was undetectable (individual assay sensitivity varied from   < 5 to   < 30 mcg/L) in 7 of the infants and was 6.5 mcg/L in 1 infant.[22] Eight breastfed and 8 formula-fed newborn infants whose mothers were receiving methadone maintenance in a median dose of 70 mg daily (range 50 to 105 mg daily) had methadone measured in their plasma on day 14 of life. Concentrations ranged from 2.2 to 8.1 mcg/L compared with maternal plasma concentrations ranging from 134 to 939 mcg/L. No correlation was found between the infant plasma concentrations and their mother's methadone dosage, their breastfeeding status, or whether the infant received treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome.[30] A 1-year-old infant who was breastfed only during the night had a serum concentration of 2 mcg/L at 12 hours after breastfeeding. Maternal methadone dosage was not specified.[27]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "One center reported 10 women who breastfed during methadone maintenance with no observed adverse effects in their infants.[17] The death of a 5-week-old infant who was born 1 week prematurely to a former heroin-abusing mother was possibly related to methadone in breastmilk. The infant had been breastfeeding since birth and the mother was taking an unreported daily dose of oral methadone maintenance. The medical examiner's diagnosis was methadone intoxication. A high level of methadone was found in the infant's serum at autopsy; however, the high level might have been caused by postpartum redistribution (which can be 2- to 10-fold[31]). The infant was also noted to be \"obviously malnourished.\" Abnormal brain, liver and other organs on autopsy were also found and it appeared that the infant had been neglected.[32][33] Three breastfed term infants of mothers taking oral methadone maintenance 45 to 70 mg daily during pregnancy and lactation had no reported adverse effects. They were cared for in a well-baby nursery after birth and discharged in good health home with their mothers at 2 to 3 days of age. At follow up over 3 weeks to 6 months of age, the infants had no symptoms of sedation or methadone withdrawal while breastfeeding. One infant who had breastfeeding discontinued at 3 weeks of age developed withdrawal symptoms of hyperirritability and sleeplessness. The other 2 infants were slowly weaned over 4 to 6 months and did not experience withdrawal upon breastfeeding discontinuation. The authors cautioned against abrupt breastfeeding discontinuation during methadone maintenance.[20] A partially breastfed 3.5-month-old infant of a mother taking oral methadone maintenance 73 mg once daily died of sudden infant death syndrome. The mother was reportedly mostly bottle feeding the infant due to diminished milk supply. There was no methadone detected in the infant's blood at autopsy (lower limit of the assay not reported).[19] Twelve term breastfed (extent not stated) newborns of mothers taking oral methadone maintenance (range 20 to 80 mg daily) during pregnancy and lactation were observed during their first week of age. Seven of these infants developed methadone withdrawal and 6 required treatment. The authors considered maternal methadone maintenance to be compatible with breastfeeding in the first week of a newborn's life but cautioned that newborn methadone withdrawal may occur despite breastfeeding.[22] The hospital course of 88 breastfed newborns were compared to 32 non-breastfed newborns. All had mothers taking oral methadone maintenance at an average dose of 40 mg daily (range 5 to 175 mg daily). Although the breastfed newborns developed neonatal abstinence syndrome and required rehospitalization after discharge at the same rate as bottle-fed infants, they did have a shorter hospital stay than bottle-fed newborns.[34] Two fully breastfed term infants of mothers taking oral methadone maintenance 70 and 130 mg daily during pregnancy and lactation had no adverse effects and required no treatment for methadone withdrawal prior to postpartum hospital discharge at 8 and 6 days of age, respectively. Both infants were rehospitalized and treated for methadone withdrawal symptoms at 6 weeks and 17 days of age, respectively, shortly after their mothers abruptly discontinued breastfeeding. The authors surmised that the appearance of symptoms were probably due to withdrawal from methadone in breastmilk.[35] A Swiss descriptive report found that among the newborns of 84 mothers on methadone maintenance, the neonatal abstinence syndrome was less frequent in breastfed infants than in non-breastfed infants, 26% and 78%, respectively. Twenty-seven infants were breastfed and 54 were formula-fed. \"Breastfed\" was defined by the authors as more than 50% of feeding from breastmilk while in the hospital.[36] A 5-week-old breastfed infant became cyanotic and required mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and intubation. The infant's urine was positive for opioids and the infant responded positively to naloxone; the level of consciousness improved over 2 days and extubation was accomplished. The infant's mother admitted to taking methadone and a hydrocodone-acetaminophen combination product that had been prescribed for migraine headache before she was breastfeeding.[37] A retrospective review from Australia was conducted on the medical records of 190 drug-dependent mothers and their infants. One hundred forty-nine of the mothers were taking methadone at delivery; 62 mothers taking methadone (average dose 68.5 mg daily; maximum dose 150 mg daily) breastfed their infants and 87 mothers taking methadone (average dose 79.6 mg daily) formula-fed their infants. Breastfed infants had a longer median time to withdrawal symptoms (10 days) than formula-fed infants (3 days). Breastfed infants were less likely to require pharmacologic treatment and doses of morphine required to treat withdrawal were lower in breastfed infants. Treatment duration was also shorter in breastfed infants (85 vs. 108 days).[38] A hospital in England reported outcomes among infants whose mothers were taking methadone maintenance during pregnancy over 2 time periods. Several changes were made in the management of mothers taking methadone between the 2 time periods. In the first time period (1991-1994), only 10% breastfed their infants (4% exclusive); in the second time period (1997-2001), 30% breastfed their infants (20% exclusive). During the second time period, the frequency of jaundice, and convulsions were less frequent in all infants, even though the average maternal methadone dose was twice as high as in the earlier period. Pharmacologic treatment of the infants for withdrawal, days of hospitalization, days in intensive care, and percentage of infants admitted to intensive care were all lower during the second time period.[39] Eight breastfed and 8 formula-fed newborn infants whose mothers were receiving methadone maintenance in a median dose of 70 mg daily (range 50 to 105 mg daily). No differences were noted between infants in the 2 groups on days 3, 14 or 30 in 9 neurobehavioral measures or on the percentage requiting pharmacologic management of withdrawal.[30] Four of these breastfed infants were followed for 6 months. No health concerns arose during this time. Another infant who was partially breastfed for 1 year had no important health or developmental problems during this time.[27] A retrospective review of the charts of 68 newborn infants exposed to methadone in utero found that infants who were breastfed had a trend towards requiring shorter durations of treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome, although the trend was not statistically significant.[40] A retrospective cohort study reviewed the records of 437 newborn infants whose mothers were taking methadone maintenance therapy. Infants who were breastfed for 72 or more hours had a 45% reduced risk of experiencing neonatal abstinence syndrome compared to those who were not. Neonatal abstinence syndrome was more likely in mothers who were also receiving a benzodiazepine.[41] A 13-month-old infant was being primarily breastfed by a mother who was taking hydrocodone and acetaminophen for pain. On 2 occasions 4 hours apart, she substituted a dose of 40 mg of methadone for the acetaminophen-hydrocodone combination. The child nursed 2 and 6 hours after the second dose for 45 minutes each time, then fell asleep for 45 minutes. Forty-five minutes later, the infant's mother noted that the infant was drowsy and not responsive. Emergency responders confirmed that the baby had cyanosis, myosis, and decreased breathing. Upon arrival at the emergency room, the child was unarousable, but had normal vital signs. The baby awoke after naloxone 0.2 mg was given intravenously. The infant's urine drug screen was positive for opiates, including methadone metabolites. Eighteen hours after the mother's first dose, the infant remained intermittently drowsy with oxygen saturation dropping as low as 91%. During this 18-hour time period, the infant had received 4 doses of naloxone intravenously. Eventually, the baby returned to normal state of good health.[42] A retrospective study in the United States of 128 infants exposed during pregnancy and breastfeeding to methadone found an inverse relationship between the amount of breastfeeding and duration of hospitalization for neonatal abstinence syndrome. Five of the breastfed infants were readmitted for withdrawal symptoms after discontinuing or markedly reducing breastmilk intake after discharge.[8] A retrospective review of the charts of the infants of mothers taking methadone during pregnancy and postpartum at 2 hospitals in Maine was made. Infants who breastfed (n = 8) had lower neonatal abstinence scores than infants who were formula-fed (n = 9) or had mixed feeding (n = 11).[43] A retrospective review of the charts of the infants of mothers taking methadone during pregnancy and postpartum at an Ontario Canada hospital was made. Infants who were breastfed (n = 14) had statistically significantly shorter hospital stays than those who were given formula or mixed feeding (n = 118).[9] A retrospective cohort study of the infants of 354 mothers receiving methadone maintenance in Glasgow, Scotland compared the weight loss of infants who were breastfed to those who were given formula. Infants in the entire breastfed (including partial) group lost a maximum of 10.2% of body weight after birth compared with a weight loss of 8.5% in the formula-fed group and 9.3% in the exclusively breastfed subgroup. Weight loss was less in infants who were small for gestational age compared to infants with normal birth weights. Median maximal weight loss occurred on day 5 postpartum, except for exclusively breastfed infants in whom it occurred on day 4. Neither methadone dose nor polydrug abuse correlated with weight loss. These weight loss values were greater than local values for infants who were not exposed to drugs.[44] A tertiary care hospital in British Columbia analyzed the charts of 295 women receiving methadone maintenance who delivered an infant over a 39-month period. Infants who were breastfed had a 79% reduced chance of requiring morphine to treat withdrawal symptoms than nonbreastfed infants. All infants were rooming-in, which may have assisted by increasing on-demand feeding and skin-to-skin contact.[45] A cohort of 124 infants exposed during pregnancy to maternal medication for opioid maintenance therapy were followed postpartum in a Norwegian study. Seventy-eight infants were born to mothers taking methadone. Overall, infants who were breastfed had a lower rate of neonatal abstinence symptoms and a shorter duration of therapy for neonatal abstinence. Among infants exposed to methadone, 53% of breastfed infants and 80% of nonbreastfed infants required treatment. Breastfed infants required treatment for an average of 31 days compared with an average of 49 days among nonbreastfed.[10] Two infants whose mothers were on methadone maintenance therapy died. Both infants were heterozygous for the lower activity form of the P-glycoprotein transporter, and one had a pharmacogenetic variant for CYP2B6 thought to reduce methadone metabolism. Both also had other factors that could have contributed to their deaths. The authors state that it would inappropriate to assume that methadone from breastmilk was the sole cause of death in thee infants.[31] A study of pregnant being treated for opiate addiction with methadone at a clinic in Vienna were followed as were their newborn infants. Compared to infants who were not breastfed (n = 118), breastfed infants (n = 48) had lower average measures of neonatal abstinence, lower dosage requirements of morphine (4.35 mg vs 12.65 mg), shorter durations of treatment for neonatal abstinence (8.1 vs 17 days) and shorter hospital stays (17.2 vs 29.4 days).[46]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Methadone can increase serum prolactin.[46] However, the prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In a French multicenter prospective study of 246 pregnant women in receiving either methadone or buprenorphine for opiate addiction, 93 women were receiving methadone. Twenty-four percent of women receiving methadone breastfed their infants, which was not different from those receiving buprenorphine.[47] Successful breastfeeding was reported in New Zealand in 15 infants whose mothers were taking methadone for pain and 18 infants whose mothers were taking methadone for maintenance of narcotic abstinence. Both groups of mothers were taking a wide range of doses with median daily dosages of 40 and 60 mg, respectively. An additional 8 infants were bottle-fed and the feeding method was unknown in 2.[48] A woman who was not breastfeeding, but who had 2 children (breastfeeding history not stated), was prescribed methadone 30 mg daily for heroin addiction. When the dose was increased to 40 mg daily, she developed galactorrhea. Her serum prolactin levels were elevated on 3 occasions over the next year, but all other examinations were normal. Galactorrhea and amenorrhea persisted for at least 2 years with continuous methadone use. The authors of the article stated that 3 cases of hyperprolactinemia had been reported to the United Kingdom's drug regulatory agency. Causality was not proven in any of these cases.[49] A case series of opiate-dependent mothers who delivered in a Baby Friendly Hospital found that mothers taking methadone or buprenorphine for opiate addiction were unlikely to breastfeed their infants. Only 27% of the 132 mothers on methadone maintenance initiated breastfeeding. Of all women in the study, 60% discontinued breastfeeding before discharge from the hospital.[50]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Because miconazole has poor oral bioavailability, it is unlikely to adversely affect the breastfed infant, including topical application to the nipples. However, miconazole ointment appears to have no advantage over lanolin for treating sore nipples during breastfeeding[1] and a survey of  members of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine found topical miconazole is rarely prescribed to nursing mothers to treat thrush.[2] Any excess cream or ointment should be removed from the nipples before nursing. Only water-miscible cream or gel products should be applied to the breast because ointments may expose the infant to high levels of mineral paraffins via licking.[3]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "The small amounts of midazolam excreted into breastmilk would not be expected to cause adverse effects in most breastfed infants. Two expert panels advocates waiting for at least 4 hours after a single intravenous dose of midazolam (e.g., for endoscopy) before resuming nursing.[1][2] However, no waiting period or discarding of milk might be necessary before resuming breastfeeding after a single dose of midazolam in the mothers of infants over 2 months of age. After general anesthesia, breastfeeding can be resumed as soon as the mother has recovered sufficiently from general anesthesia to nurse.[3][4][5] When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. With prolonged use (days) of intravenous therapy, an active metabolite can accumulate in the mother and might affect the infant, but data in breastfeeding are lacking."
    drug_levels: "Midazolam is about 36% bioavailable orally in adults. It is metabolized to 1-hydroxymidazolam (60 to 70%) and 4-hydroxymidazolam (5%) which are about equipotent to midazolam. The half-life of 1-hydroxymidazolam is about 12 hours in adults and can accumulate with prolonged or repeated doses or in renal impairment. Maternal Levels:   Twelve mothers were given a total of 30 doses of oral midazolam 15 mg for sleep in the first 5 days postpartum if they requested it. In 11 of the mothers, midazolam was unmeasurable (  < 3 mcg/L) in breastmilk 7 hours after the dose. One of the mothers accidentally took a second tablet (30 mg total) on one occasion and had a 7-hour milk level of 9 mcg/L. No accumulation occurred with repeated nightly doses in any of the mothers. Two additional women who were 2 to 3 months postpartum had hourly milk sampling after a single 15 mg dose. Peak milk levels of both the drug and metabolite occurred at 1 and 2 hours after the dose in the 2 patients. Peak milk levels of midazolam plus 1-hydroxymidazolam were about 13 mcg/L and the average milk level over the 7-hour period was 6.7 mcg/L.[6] Using these values, an infant exclusively nursing for 7 hours after a dose would receive about 0.3 mcg of the drug plus metabolite. A mother undergoing surgery received a single 6 mg dose of midazolam intravenously for anesthesia induction. Breastmilk concentration of midazolam was 25 mcg/L at 30 minutes after the dose, 12 mcg/L at 1 hour after the dose and 7 mcg/L at 2 hours after the dose. From 4 hours onward the drug was unmeasurable (  < 5 mcg/L). Hydroxymidazolam was not measured.[7] Five women who were 6 to 15 weeks postpartum were given a single dose of 2 mg of midazolam intravenously before undergoing general anesthesia. Several milk samples were collected between 5 and 24 hours after the injection from each woman. The authors estimated that the infants would receive an average of 0.016 mcg/kg in the 24 hours after a single dose of midazolam. This corresponds to 0.06% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Hydroxymidazolam was not measured. The women's milk output following the surgical procedure was less than half of the normal milk output of nursing mothers. The authors concluded that this amount of midazolam in milk is unlikely to affect a healthy, term infant.[5][8] The infants of mothers not undergoing a surgical procedure might receive a greater dose of midazolam in breastmilk, but it would be unlikely to be a large dose.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Epidural morphine given to mothers for postcesarean section analgesia results in trivial amounts of morphine in their colostrum and milk. Intravenous or oral doses of maternal morphine in the immediate postpartum period result in higher milk levels than with epidural morphine. Labor pain medication may delay the onset of lactation. Maternal use of oral narcotics during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, central nervous system depression and even death. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of morphine to a few days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately."
    drug_levels: "Morphine is metabolized to inactive morphine-3-glucuronide (60%) and to active morphine-6-glucuronide (10%). Morphine has an oral bioavailability of about 30% in adults. Morphine-6-glucuronide has an oral bioavailability of about 4%,[1] but is probably converted back to morphine in the infant's gut and absorbed as morphine. The plasma clearance of morphine is prolonged in very young infants compared to older infants and children.[2][3] Usual therapeutic intravenous doses of morphine in infants are 10 mcg/kg/hour or 50 to 100 mcg/kg as a single dose. Usual single oral doses of morphine in infants are 100 to 500 mcg/kg. Maternal Levels: Five lactating mothers who were at least 1 month postpartum were given 1 to 2 doses of either epidural 4 mg or parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) 5 to 15 mg morphine every 4 to 6 hours for postoperative analgesia. Milk was sampled from each mother 10 times over the 8 hours after her dose. The peak milk level after epidural morphine was 82 mcg/L and occurred 30 minutes after a second dose. The peak milk level after parenteral morphine was about 500 mcg/L and occurred about 45 minutes after a single 15 mg (10 mg intravenous plus 5 mg intramuscular) dose. The half-life in milk was about 3 hours.[4] Using the peak milk levels from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 75 mcg/kg daily.Six women who received epidural morphine 5 mg for labor analgesia had their initial colostrum sampled postpartum (range 24-100 hours after epidural). Morphine was undetectable (  < 0.6 mcg/L) in 4 of the women. The peak morphine level was 4.5 mcg/L and was measured 28 hours after the epidural dose.[5] Considering the small amount of colostrum consumed by the infant, based on the peak level in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would only receive a negligible amount of morphine from a maternal epidural 5 mg morphine dose for labor analgesia.Five mothers who had undergone cesarean section delivery at term were given intravenous morphine 7.5 mg after umbilical cord clamping and then 1 to 1.5 mg every 6 minutes via intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) as needed for up to 48 hours postpartum. When PCA morphine was discontinued, oral morphine 5-30 mg every 2 to 3 hours as needed was given. Colostrum and milk were sampled from each of the mothers 6 times over 96 hours postpartum. Average milk levels from all the mothers studied were about 50 to 65 mcg/L in the first 48 hours postpartum and then dropped to about 20 mcg/L by 72 to 96 hours postpartum. The average cumulative intravenous only dose in the first 48 hours post partum was about 150 mg. The average cumulative intravenous plus oral morphine dose over the entire 96 hours was about 250 mg.[6] Using the average milk levels reported at each of the 6 collection times from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 5 mcg/kg daily. Using the maximum level of 65 mcg/L reported in the first 48 hours postpartum when mothers were receiving intravenous morphine, and assuming 30% oral absorption by the infant, an exclusively breastfed infant would absorb a maximum of about 3 mcg/kg daily equal to 0.3% of the intravenous maternal weight-adjusted daily dosage. One mother who was 21 days postpartum received oral morphine 10 mg every 6 hours for 4 doses then 5 mg every 6 hours for 2 doses. She had a peak morphine breastmilk level of 100 mcg/L at 1 hour after breastfeeding and 4.5 hours after her first 5 mg dose.[7] Using the peak milk level from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 15 mcg/kg daily, equal to about 3% of the maternal daily dosage, assuming a daily maternal oral morphine dose of 40 mg. Epidural morphine 5 mg was given to 30 women immediately following cesarean section and again 24 hours later. There were measurable colostrum morphine levels 12 to 36 hours after delivery in only 3 of the women (range 0.39 to 0.66 mcg/L). The remaining 27 women had undetectable (  < 0.12 mcg/L) morphine milk levels.[8] One breastfeeding woman receiving 4 to 8 mg daily of continuous intrathecal morphine had her milk sampled 11 times over 7 weeks postpartum. Levels in milk were undetectable (  < 8 mcg/L) in 8 of the 11 samples. In 3 of the 11 samples, morphine was detected, but only at levels below the quantification sensitivity of the assay (8 to 25 mcg/L) and was not related to maternal dose.[9] Using the maximum possible milk level of 25 mcg/L from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 3 mcg/kg daily from this maternal intrathecal morphine dose regimen.Seven women who had preterm infants delivered by cesarean section were started on intravenous morphine 7 to 10 mg over 30 to 60 minutes, then 1 mg every 10 minutes by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) as needed, for up to 48 hours postpartum. Colostrum samples were taken just prior to PCA initiation and again at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postpartum. The average cumulative morphine dose was about 60 mg in 48 hours. Three of the women could not produce enough milk for sampling. Morphine and its active 6-glucuronide metabolite were detectable in 3 of the remaining 4 women. There was high intersubject variability with peak milk levels occurring at different times and a wide range of levels measured in each of the women. The peak milk morphine level was 48 mcg/L and the peak 6-glucuronide metabolite level was 1,084 mcg/L. The authors reported median morphine levels of 34, 24, 7, 6.5 and 21 mcg/L and 6-glucuronide levels of 273, 672, 426, 527 and 350 mcg/L at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, respectively.[10] Using the reported median milk levels from the 60 mg cumulative 48 hour maternal morphine dose in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 2.4 mcg/kg daily of morphine and 73 mcg/kg daily of the 6-glucuronide metabolite. Using the peak milk level data from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an estimated maximum of 7.2 mcg/kg daily of morphine and 163 mcg/kg daily of the 6-glucuronide metabolite. Twelve women who underwent cesarean section deliveries at 37 to 41 weeks of gestation received a single dose of 2 mg of morphine epidurally. Colostrum was collected at several times during the first 24 hours postpartum. The highest average morphine concentration was reported to be 6.2 mg/L and occurred in colostrum 3.2 hours after the cesarean section. The morphine concentration fell with an average half-life of 2.9 hours. By 6 hours after the dose, the reported concentration was 1.1 mg/L. By 24 hours, the drug was undetectable in colostrum.[11] Note: it is likely that this paper reported the milk concentration values in the wrong units. The values reported were probably in mcg/L, not mg/L. Infant Levels: In a term infant, the measured plasma morphine level was 1.2 mcg/L. The measurement was taken 108 hours after the mother's last dose of morphine and no morphine was detected in her milk. The mother's dose was not reported.[12] One mother of a term 21-day-old breastfeeding infant received a 10-day tapering dose of oral morphine beginning with 50 mg every 6 hours. On day 9 she received 10 mg every 6 hours then 5 mg every 6 hours on day 10. The infant's serum morphine level was 4 mcg/L measured 1 hour after breastfeeding and 4 hours after the first 5 mg dose on day 10. Because this serum level occurred while the mother was taking a lower morphine dose, the authors surmised that the infant likely had serum milk levels in what they considered a therapeutic range of over 20 mcg/L during the time the mother was taking higher morphine doses.[7]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In a term infant with unexplained apnea and bradycardia with cyanosis while hospitalized in the first week of life, the measured plasma morphine in the infant was 1.2 mcg/L. The measurement was taken 108 hours after the mother's last dose of morphine and no morphine was detected in her milk. The mother's dose was not reported.[12] Breastfed newborns of mothers using intravenous PCA morphine for postcesarean analgesia were more alert and better oriented after postpartum day 3 than infants of mothers using intravenous PCA meperidine and nonbreastfed control infants. There was no difference in newborn respiratory rates. The authors stated that the mothers of nonbreastfed infants had greater parity than the breastfeeding mothers which, combined with a presumed lower desire to breastfeed, may have contributed to the lower behavioral and alertness scores in the nonbreastfed newborns.[6][13] A study of pregnant being treated for opiate addiction with slow-release oral morphine at a clinic in Vienna were followed as were their newborn infants. Compared to infants who were not breastfed (n = 91), breastfed infants (n = 21) had lower average measures of neonatal abstinence, lower dosage requirements of morphine (5.23 mg vs 8.75 mg), shorter durations of treatment for neonatal abstinence (10.2 vs 18.1 days) and shorter hospital stays (19.7 vs 31 days).[14]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Morphine can increase serum prolactin.[15] However, the prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. A national survey of women and their infants from late pregnancy through 12 months postpartum compared the time of lactogenesis II in mothers who did and did not receive pain medication during labor. Categories of medication were spinal or epidural only, spinal or epidural plus another medication, and other pain medication only. Women who received medications from any of the categories had about twice the risk of having delayed lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) compared to women who received no labor pain medication.[16]"

Milk samples were collected several times beginning at 1 hour and finishing at 24 hours after the dose. The half-life of elimination from milk was about 8 hours. A reported peak milk level in one mother was about 25 mcg/L and it occurred 1 hour after the dose. The average milk level over the 24 hour study period in all 7 mothers was about 5 mcg/L (range 1.5 to 20 mcg/L).[1] Using the peak level reported in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a dosage of 3.7 mcg/kg daily, equivalent to 1.1 % of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Using the average milk level from this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would ingest 0.75 mcg/kg daily, equivalent to 0.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage or 0.25 to 1% of the infant parenteral dosage. Eighteen women were administered nalbuphine 0.2 mg/kg intravenously every 4 hours (average 25.5 mcg/kg daily) for pain following cesarean section. Milk samples were collected every 3 hours during the second day of drug administration. Because of small milk volumes, only 32 samples from 14 of the women were collected. The average milk nalbuphine concentration was 42 mcg/L, and the average maximum milk concentration was 61 mcg/L.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited information indicates that oxcarbazepine  would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants, especially if the infant is older than 2 months. Monitor the infant for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of anticonvulsants."
    drug_levels: "In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women are taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some of the other drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other anticonvulsants whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other anticonvulsants. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than usual. Maternal Levels: Two women were treated with oxcarbazepine during pregnancy and lactation. Milk levels of the 10-hydroxy-oxcarbazepine metabolite in breastmilk were 50 to 65% of the maternal blood level in one mother during the first week postpartum. In the second mother, milk levels were 70 to 80% of maternal plasma levels during the first 2 months postpartum and 45 to 50% at 2.5 to 4.5 months postpartum. Specific values were not provided in the abstract.[1] An epileptic woman took oxcarbazepine orally 300 mg 3 times daily during pregnancy and postpartum. Five milk levels of oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite 10-hydroxy-oxcarbazepine taken in the 6 months postpartum were about 50% of maternal blood levels which averaged 380 mcg/L and 5.7 mg/L, respectively. Therefore, milk levels averaged about 190 mcg/L for oxcarbazepine and 2.85 mg/L for 10-hydroxy-oxcarbazepine, although the authors reported that the assay method was not very accurate for breastmilk.[2]A woman diagnosed with bipolar disorder was taking oxcarbazepine 300 mg every 12 hours (9 mg/kg) by mouth. Milk and blood samples were taken in the morning 11 hours after the previous dose twice at 8 and 23 days postpartum. Oxcarbazepine levels in milk were 0.9 and 1 mg/L, respectively and the levels of the 10-hydroxy metabolite were 5.6 and 10.4 mg/L on the 2 days, respectively. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive between 1.5 to 1.7% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage of oxcarbazepine and its metabolite.[3] Infant Levels: Transplacentally acquired plasma levels of oxcarbazepine and 10-hydroxy-oxcarbazepine fell over a 5-day monitoring period in a newborn despite intake via breastmilk. The infant's mother was taking oxcarbazepine orally 300 mg 3 times daily.[2]A woman diagnosed with bipolar disorder was taking oxcarbazepine 300 mg every 12 hours (9 mg/kg) by mouth. Blood samples were obtained from her breastfed infant (extent not stated) after breastfeeding (exact time not stated) on 2 occasions, at 8 and 23 days of age. The infant had serum concentrations of oxcarbazepine of 0.1 and   < 0.1 mg/L, respectively and serum concentrations of 10-hydroxy-oxcarbazepine of   < 0.1 and 0.2 mg/L at the 2 times, respectively. The infants total drug levels were   < 2.7 and   < 2.5% of the maternal serum concentrations on the two days.[3] Two infants whose mothers were taking oxcarbazepine during pregnancy and postpartum breastfeeding (extent not stated) had blood samples at 3 to 4 weeks of age. Their serum 10-hydroxy-oxcarbazepine concentrations were about 5% of their mothers' serum concentrations.[4]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Two infants were born to mothers who were taking oxcarbazepine (dosage not stated) during pregnancy and postpartum. One infant was breastfed for 1 week and the other for at least 4.5 months (extent not stated). Both infants developed normally.[1] One infant was breastfed (extent not stated) from day 3 to at least 6 months of age during maternal therapy with oxcarbazepine 300 mg 3 times daily. Examination of the infant at 13 months of age indicated normal development with no signs of mental retardation or neurologic deficit.[2] An epileptic woman took oxcarbazepine 600 mg twice daily throughout pregnancy and lactation. Her breastfed infant developed normally during the first 4 months of breastfeeding.[5] A woman took oxcarbazepine monotherapy throughout pregnancy and postpartum for complex partial seizures. She breastfed her infant with some formula supplementation (extent not stated) for 6 months while taking a an oxcarbazepine dosage of 900 mg twice daily. Her infant achieved all developmental milestones for the first 3 years of life.[6] An infant was breastfed (extent not stated) for 18 weeks by a mother who took oxcarbazepine 300 mg every 12 hours (9 mg/kg) during pregnancy and postpartum. At 23 days of age, liver function tests were normal. No adverse drug effects or developmental delay were seen up to age 5 years.[3] No adverse effects were reported in 10 newborns who were 4 to 23 days old who were breastfed during maternal intake of levetiracetam 1000 to 3000 mg daily. One mother was also taking tiagabine 30 mg daily, clobazam 45 mg daily and oxcarbazepine 600 mg daily.[7]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Maternal use of oral narcotics during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, central nervous system depression and even death. Infant sedation is common and well documented with maternal use of oxycodone. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral oxycodone (and combinations) to a few days. A maximum oxycodone dosage of 30 mg daily is suggested. Oxycodone elimination is decreased in young infants with much inter-individual variability. Monitor the infant closely for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately. Other agents are preferred over oxycodone during breastfeeding.[1]"
    drug_levels: "Oxycodone is metabolized to the active metabolites, noroxycodone and oxymorphone. Oxycodone has an oral bioavailability of 60% to 87% in adults.[2] Oxycodone elimination is decreased in young infants and much inter-individual variability exists. Oxycodone can be dangerous when used as an analgesic in newborns.[3] Maternal Levels: Six breastfeeding mothers who were using 1 to 2 capsules containing a combination of 5 mg oxycodone and 500 mg acetaminophen every 4 to 7 hours for post-cesarean section pain had their milk sampled several times after successive doses. Peak oxycodone milk levels reportedly occurred 1 to 2 hours after the first dose and then at variable times after successive doses. The number of hours after a mother's last dose when oxycodone could still be measured in milk was depended on  the number of doses taken. Oxycodone could be measured in milk up to 4, 12, and 36 hours after 4, 9, and 11 doses respectively. In all the mothers, measured oxycodone milk levels ranged from undetectable (  < 5 mcg/L) to 229 mcg/L. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a maximum 8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of oxycodone, but active metabolite levels were not measured.[4] Fifty mothers who delivered by cesarean section and received oxycodone had milk (colostrum) and serum samples measured for oxycodone at 24, 48 and 72 hours postpartum without respect to the time of the previous oxycodone dose. The most common doses received by the mothers during the previous 24 hours (including one 30 mg dose rectally immediately post surgery in some cases) were 60 mg (range 30 to 90 mg), 40 mg (range 0 to 90 mg), and 20 mg (range 0 to 50 mg), respectively. Mean colostrum concentrations at the 3 collection times were 58 mcg/L (range 7 to 130 mcg/L), 49 mcg/L (range 0 to 168 mcg/L), and 35 mcg/L (range 0 to 31 mcg/L), respectively. Little correlation was found between maternal dosage and colostrum concentrations, although colostrum levels correlated well with maternal serum levels, with a colostrum concentrations 3.2 to 3.4 higher than serum. Ten mothers had colostrum oxycodone concentrations over 100 mcg/L and 5 had detectable oxycodone in milk 37 hours after the last dose.[5] Infant Levels: In a study of 50 mothers taking oxycodone post-cesarean section, 45 blood samples were taken from 41 breastfed infants at 24, 48 or 72 hours postpartum. Only 1 of the samples had a detectable  (  > 2 mcg/L) oxycodone level of 7.4 mcg/L. Because these infants were in the first 3 days postpartum, their dose was probably limited by the small volumes of colostrum they were ingesting.[5] A woman who was exclusively breastfeeding her infant was taking 5 to 10 mg of oxycodone every 4 to 6 hours for episiotomy pain. Her 45-day-old infant's urine drug screen showed a concentration of    > 2000 mcg/L (positive cutoff for opioid metabolites was 5 mcg/L).[6]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A 10-month-old, 7.7 kg infant of a prescription drug-dependant mother died of cardiac arrest after a 12- to 24-hour period of lethargy, hypersomnolence and dyspnea. The infant also had a recent history of fever. The mother had reportedly been breastfeeding the infant 3 times a day for several weeks and had taken 180 mg of oxycodone, as well as muscle relaxants, the day prior to her infant's death. A blood oxycodone level of 600 mcg/L was measured on autopsy. The medical examiner considered it unlikely that such a high level of oxycodone in the infant's blood could be due to breastfeeding exposure as reported by the mother and thus considered the death a homicide resulting from either the intentional administration of oxycodone directly to the infant or from a higher dose of oxycodone in breastmilk than that reported by the mother.[7] In a study of 50 mothers taking oxycodone post-cesarean section, 50 neonates were evaluated for sedation over 48 hours after birth. None was severely sedated and less than 4% had sedation of 3 on a 1 (fully alert) to 5 (difficult to rouse) scale and none more sedated than 3 on the scale. Because these infants were in the first 3 days postpartum, their oxycodone dose was probably limited by the small volumes of colostrum they were ingesting.[5] An infant was born to a mother taking oxycodone 20 mg 3 times daily, fluoxetine 40 mg daily and quetiapine 400 mg daily. The infant was breastfed 6 to 7 times daily and was receiving 120 mcg of oral morphine 3 times daily for opiate withdrawal. Upon examination at 3 months of age, the infant's weight was at the 25th percentile for age, having been at the 50th percentile at birth. The authors attributed the weight loss to opiate withdrawal. The infant's Denver developmental score was equal to his chronological age.[8]A woman who was exclusively breastfeeding her infant was taking 5 to 10 mg of oxycodone every 4 to 6 hours for episiotomy pain. Her 45-day-old infant was brought to the emergency department with a temperature of 98.4 degrees F, a heart rate of 154 per minute, 20 breaths per minute, a blood pressure of 71/52, and an oxygen saturation of 60% to 69% on room air. The infant had been constipated since birth, passing one stool every 5 to 8 days. The infant had sluggish movements slow, shallow, and irregular breathing. Her pupils were small, but reactive. Hydromorphone levels in urine were elevated. The patient was intubated and given opiates around the clock for two days before being extubated and discharged. The infant's constipation, CNS and respiratory depression were probably caused by oxycodone in breastmilk.[6] In a retrospective study, nursing mothers who were taking either oxycodone, codeine or acetaminophen for pain while breastfeeding were contacted by telephone to ascertain the degree of maternally perceived central nervous system (CNS) depression. Mothers taking oxycodone reported signs of CNS depression in 20% (28/139) of their infants, while those taking acetaminophen reported infant CNS depression in only 0.5% (1/184) of their infants. Women who reported infant sedation were taking 0.4 mg/kg daily of  oxycodone, and unaffected were taking 0.15 mg/kg daily. Affected infants had more hours of daily uninterrupted sleep than unaffected infants, and 4 of the affected infants reportedly had \"irregular breathing\". Thirty-eight of 39 mothers reported that infant sedation ceased with maternal oxycodone discontinuation. Mothers of affected infants were also more likely to experience lethargy and other side effects than mothers of unaffected infants. Mothers who took codeine reported a similar rate of infant sedation (17%) compared to oxycodone, but the groups were statistically different in parity and postmenstrual age (PMA), with the codeine group having a slightly higher PMA.[9] A newborn infant was exclusively breastfed and found to be well by his physician at 2 days of age. At 3 days postpartum, the infant began to be sedated and became difficult to arouse and did not feed from either breast. At 4 days of age, the infant was brought to the emergency department where the infant was found to have lethargy, hypothermia, pinpoint pupils, and a poor sucking reflex. The mother reported that her milk had come in the previous evening. She had taken 10 mg of oxycodone that evening and another 5 mg the next morning in the form of Percocet (oxycodone 5 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg). The infant was given naloxone 0.34 mg intramuscularly and within 2 minutes, the baby's eyes opened and he drank 45 mL of formula. No further sedation was seen over the next 24 hours.[10] The infant's sedation was probably caused by oxycodone in breastmilk."
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Oxycodone can increase serum prolactin.[11] However, the prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Inter- and intrapatient variability in excretion of phenobarbital into breastmilk is extensive. Phenobarbital in breastmilk apparently can decrease withdrawal symptoms in infants who were exposed in utero, but it can also cause drowsiness in some infants, especially when used with other sedating drugs. Monitor the infant for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of psychotropic drugs. Sometimes breastfeeding might have to be limited or discontinued because of excessive drowsiness and poor weight gain. If there is concern, measurement of the infant's serum phenobarbital concentration might help rule out toxicity."
    drug_levels: "In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. In women taking phenobarbital for 3 days, average milk levels at 23 hours after the last dose were as follows: 90 mg daily in 4 women, 0.85 mg/L (range 0.8 to 1 mg/L); 150 mg daily in 2 women, 1.25 mg/L (range 1 to 1.5 mg/L); 225 mg daily in 2 women, 5.2 mg/L (range 2.7 to 5 mg/L). The same paper reported 2 women taking phenobarbital 125 mg 3 times daily along with phenytoin. Milk phenobarbital levels were fairly constant during the day, averaging from 5.6 to 6 mg/L at 6 am, 10 am and 8 pm in one woman between days 3 and 7 postpartum. In the other, milk levels averaged 7.3, 7.8 and 8.8 mg/L at 6 am, 10 am and 8 pm, respectively, between days 5 and 11 postpartum.[1] A breastmilk phenobarbital level of 2.7 mg/L was found 16 hours after the last dose in a patient taking 30 mg 4 times daily for 3.5 days at 6 days postpartum.[2] Eight phenobarbital breastmilk levels were measured between days 3 and 32 postpartum at unstated times after the dose in an unstated number of women who were taking phenobarbital and other anticonvulsants in unstated dosages. Phenobarbital milk levels averaged 10.4 mg/L (range 0.5 to 33 mg/L), while maternal serum levels averaged 19.3 mg/L.[3] Phenobarbital breastmilk concentrations were determined in a group of 26 mothers with epilepsy who were taking phenobarbital alone or in combination with other anticonvulsants. Determinations were made at 4 times after delivery: within 5 days postpartum, 6 to 10 days postpartum, 1 to 2 months postpartum and 3 to 5 months postpartum. Levels were obtained 2 to 3 hours after the last dose of the day. Between 13 and 18 mothers provided samples in each time period. For each mg/kg of phenobarbital that the mothers took, their breastmilk concentrations increased by about 1 to 2 mg/L with monotherapy and 1.25 to 2.5 mg/L with combination therapy. The difference between monotherapy and combination therapy was statistically significant only during the first 5 days postpartum.[4]Milk samples were obtained during the first week postpartum from 4 mothers who were taking phenobarbital. Their dosages ranged from 30 to 150 mg daily in 3 divided doses and milk samples were obtained 2 to 3 hours after a dose. Milk concentrations ranged from 4.5 mg/L in a woman taking 30 mg daily to 7.6 mg/L in a woman taking 150 mg daily. Phenobarbital concentrations in milk were less than those in simultaneous maternal serum samples in all cases.[5] Using the values in this paper, the average weight-adjusted infant dosage was 72.5% (range 39 to 135%) of the maternal dosage. Infant Levels. An infant whose epileptic mother was taking phenobarbital 100 mg, primidone 625 mg, phenytoin 200 mg and sulthiame 200 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum was partially breastfed. At 17 days of age, the phenobarbital serum level was 2 mg/L. The proportion of breastfeeding was increased, and at 1 month of age, the infant's serum phenobarbital level was 12.7 mg/L. Breastfeeding continued, but by 2 months of age, the infant's serum phenobarbital concentration was 1 mg/L.[6] Phenobarbital serum concentrations were determined in a group of infants whose mothers were taking phenobarbital alone or in combination with other anticonvulsants. Determinations were made at 4 times after delivery: within 5 days postpartum, 6 to 10 days postpartum, 1 to 2 months postpartum and 3 to 5 months postpartum. Levels were obtained 2 to 3 hours after the last dose of the day. Between 14 and 18 infants provided samples in each time period. The extent of breastfeeding was not reported. For each mg/kg of phenobarbital that the mothers took, their infants' serum concentrations increased by about 2 to 5 mg/L with monotherapy and combination therapy, except during the first 5 days postpartum when an increase in serum phenoarbital concentration was about 10 mg/L for each mg/kg of the mothers' dose. The difference between monotherapy and combination therapy was statistically significant only during the first 5 days postpartum. This greater serum concentration in the early days postpartum probably reflects transplacental passage to some extent.[4] The breastfed (extent not stated) infant of a mother who was taking phenobarbital 90 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum had phenobarbital plasma levels measured on day 6 and 19 postpartum. On day 6, the plasma levels were 12.1 and 28.3 mg/L before and 2.5 hours after the mother's dose, respectively. On day 19, infant plasma levels had increased to 15.4 and 54.7 mg/L before and 2.5 hours after the mother's dose, respectively.[7]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Two 1-week-old infants whose mothers had been receiving phenobarbital 100 mg at bedtime for 3 to 5 nights exhibited deep slumber with difficulty in awakening that was possibly caused by phenobarbital in breastmilk.[8] A mother was taking phenobarbital 390 mg daily and phenytoin 400 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. Her infant was drowsy at birth, refused to suck and was given partial formula feeding. At 5 days of age, her infant was admitted to the hospital pale and collapsed with bruising, bleeding, and a decreased hemoglobin, thought to be due to methemoglobinemia. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the infant was given a transfusion which rapidly improved her condition. On day 10, the mother resumed breastfeeding the infant. Within 24 hours the infant was extremely sedated and refused to suck and was fed breastmilk with a spoon. The sedation persisted for 2 days until breastmilk was discontinued permanently because of a return of methemoglobinemia. The extreme sedation was probably due to phenobarbital in the milk and the methemoglobinemia was probably caused by the phenytoin.[9] An infant death occurred from overlying and suffocation by a parent during sleep. Sedation from phenobarbital, primidone, and phenytoin in breastmilk was possibly a contributing factor. Phenobarbital was found in the infant's serum (8 mg/L) and liver (16 mcg/g) on autopsy.[10] Probable drug withdrawal symptoms, manifested as spontaneous tremors, occurred in a breastfed infant in the third month of life when her mother who was taking phenobarbital (dose not stated) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, abruptly discontinued nursing.[11] A probable case of drug-induced drowsiness occurred in a newborn whose mother was taking primidone, carbamazepine and phenytoin (dosages not stated). At day 30, breastfeeding was discontinued because of the drowsiness that occurred after each feeding and poor weight gain. These authors also found that 13 partially breastfed infants whose mothers were taking anticonvulsants gained weight at a slower rate during the first 5 days postpartum than did 75 infants of epileptic mothers who bottle fed or control mothers taking no medications.[12]A breastfed infant whose mother was taking phenobarbital 90 mg, primidone 375 mg, and carbamazepine 800 mg daily did well despite a phenobarbital saliva level of 3.4 mg/L. At 7 months of age, after the mother abruptly stop nursing, the infant had a number of \"startle reactions\" and infantile seizures occurred which were confirmed by an abnormal electroencephalogram. Continued phenobarbital administration to the infant for 15 months controlled the seizures and no more occurred up to 5 years of age.[13]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "No direct effect is known, but mothers taking antiepileptic drugs stop breastfeeding earlier and supplement more than mothers not taking antiepileptic drugs. Most of these reports occurred in older studies in which sedating agents such as phenobarbital and primidone were used. Infant sucking difficulties and sedation were reasons given for the reduced nursing.[12][14]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Because of the low levels of phenytoin in breastmilk, amounts ingested by the infant are small and usually cause no difficulties in breastfed infants when used alone except for rare idiosyncratic reactions. Breastfeeding during phenytoin monotherapy does not appear to adversely affect infant growth or development, and breastfed infants had slightly higher IQs and enhanced verbal abilities than nonbreastfed infants at 6 years of age in one study.[1] Combination therapy with sedating anticonvulsants or psychotropics may result in infant sedation or withdrawal reactions. In one case report, maternal phenytoin dosage requirements decreased as breastfeeding was discontinued.[2]"

Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database.Maternal Levels. Two women were taking phenytoin plus phenobarbital orally. In one woman taking phenytoin 30 mg 3 times daily, milk phenytoin levels were fairly constant during the day, averaging 0.5 mg/L (ranging 0.4 to 0.7 mg/L) at 6 am, 10 am and 8 pm between days 3 and 7 postpartum. In the other woman taking 100 mg 3 times daily, milk levels averaged 0.65, 1 and 1.1 mg/L at 6 am, 10 am and 8 pm, respectively, between days 5 and 11 postpartum.[1] Two women were taking phenytoin 300 mg daily (dosage details not reported) during pregnancy and postpartum. In one, milk levels ranged from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/L at various times on days 4 to 6 postpartum. The highest levels were reported on day 6. In the other, levels ranged from 1 to 2.6 mg/L on days 1 to 4 postpartum and was 1.3 mg/L on day 33 postpartum.[3] A woman was taking phenytoin 100 mg 3 times daily. Breastmilk levels varied during the day, with a level of 1.4 mg/L before the first morning dose and a level of 4.2 mg/L 2 hours after the last dose of the day.[4]In a woman taking phenytoin 500 mg daily in 2 divided doses 12 hours apart, breastmilk phenytoin levels were 0.58 mg/L 3 hours after the morning dose and 0.26 mg/L 1 hour before the evening dose.[5] A woman usually maintained on phenytoin 300 mg daily was given a single oral dose of 100 mg of phenytoin at 7 am and no other doses on that day. The trough level of 1.2 mg/L from the previous day's dosage occurred one hour after the dose and a peak milk level of 4.5 mg/L occurred 4 hours after the dose. From 1 pm until 8 am the next morning, milk levels fluctuated between 0.5 and 1 mg/L.[6] Eight phenytoin breastmilk levels were measured between days 3 and 32 postpartum at unstated times after the dose in an unstated number of women who were taking phenytoin and other anticonvulsants in unstated dosages. Phenytoin milk levels averaged 0.8 mg/L (range 0.5 to 1.4 mg/L), while maternal serum levels averaged 4.5 mg/L[7]A mother who was taking phenytoin 200 mg twice daily had breastmilk phenytoin levels measured 5 times during days 2 to 4 postpartum. Milk levels ranged from trace to 2 mg/L.[8] Two mothers taking phenytoin during pregnancy and postpartum had breastmilk levels measured during the first week postpartum. One who was taking 300 mg daily had a milk level of 2.7 mg/L and the other who was taking 200 mg daily had a milk level of 1.7 mg/L[9] Phenytoin was measured in breastmilk in 5 women. In one taking 100 mg daily, a breastmilk levels of 0.76 mg/L was found 3 days postpartum. In 4 others taking 300 mg daily, milk levels on several occasions mostly during the first week postpartum ranged from 0.41 to 1.3 mg/L. Most of the levels were in the range of 0.5 to 0.6 mg/L.[10][11] It is estimated that a breastfed infant would receive between 0.5 and 8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of phenytoin in breastmilk.[12] Infant Levels: Six breastfed infants whose mothers were taking phenytoin 200 to 400 mg daily had serum phenytoin levels measured between 1 and 3 months of age. Only 2 of the 6 infants were found to have detectable serum levels during breastfeeding; the levels were 126 and 197 mcg/L. Only 1 infant had a measurable serum level of 4-hydroxyphenytoin of 118 mcg/L.[13]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A mother was taking phenobarbital 390 mg daily and phenytoin 400 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. Her infant was drowsy at birth, refused to suck and was given partial formula feeding. At 5 days of age, her infant was admitted to the hospital pale and collapsed with bruising, bleeding, and a decreased hemoglobin, thought to be due to methemoglobinemia. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the infant was given a transfusion which rapidly improved her condition. On day 10, the mother resumed breastfeeding the infant. Within 24 hours the infant was extremely sedated and refused to suck and was fed breastmilk with a spoon. The sedation persisted for 2 days until breastmilk was discontinued permanently because of a return of methemoglobinemia. The extreme sedation was probably due to phenobarbital in the milk and the methemoglobinemia was probably caused by the phenytoin.[14] One clinician reported that the breastfed infants of 28 mothers who were taking phenytoin 100 to 200 mg 3 times daily had no adverse reactions including drowsiness or lethargy.[15]No adverse effects were noted in the breastfed neonates of 2 mothers who were taking phenytoin 300 mg daily.[3] A 10-week-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking clemastine, phenytoin and carbamazepine was drowsy, refused to feed, was irritable, and had high-pitched crying.[16] These side effects were possibly caused by clemastine in breastmilk, but the other drugs could also have contributed. A probable case of drug-induced drowsiness occurred in a newborn whose mother was taking primidone, carbamazepine and phenytoin (dosages not stated). At day 30, breastfeeding was discontinued because of the drowsiness that occurred after each feeding and poor weight gain. The same group of researchers found that 15 partially breastfed infants whose mothers were taking various anticonvulsants, including phenytoin, gained weight at a slower rate during the first 5 days postpartum than did 75 infants of epileptic mothers who bottle fed or control mothers taking no medications.[17] Drowsiness, pallor and feeding difficulties in a 2-week-old were possibly caused by primidone and phenytoin in breastmilk. Possible drug-related drowsiness, pallor and feeding difficulties were reported in a 4-day-old whose mother was taking primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin and sulthiame.[18] Although phenytoin might have contributed to these outcomes, it is more likely that they were due primarily to the more sedating anticonvulsants, primidone and phenobarbital. Two breastfed infants (one full, one partial) whose mothers took phenytoin during pregnancy and postpartum became hyperexcitable when their serum phenytoin dropped to unmeasurable levels at 3 to 6 weeks of age.[19] In a long-term study on infants exposed to anticonvulsants during breastfeeding, no difference in average intelligence quotient at 3 years of age was found between infants who were breastfed (n = 17) a median of 6 months and those not breastfed (n = 23) when their mothers were taking phenytoin.[20] At 6 years of age, extensive psychological and intelligence testing found no difference between the breastfed and nonbreastfed infants.[1]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Ample evidence exists that primidone taken during nursing can affect the breastfed infant. Infant serum levels of primidone and its metabolites are often near or in the therapeutic range and symptoms of sedation and poor nursing have been reported. On the other hand, infants exposed in utero sometimes have withdrawal symptoms that are either alleviated by breastfeeding or worsened when breastfeeding is abruptly stopped. If primidone is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. However the infant must be monitored for drowsiness, adequate nursing and weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger, exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of anticonvulsant drugs. Measurement of an infant serum level might help rule out toxicity if there is a concern."
    drug_levels: "Primidone is metabolized to phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA) which have sedating and anticonvulsant properties. In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels:  An epileptic mother was taking primidone 250 mg 3 times daily and valproic acid 2.4 grams daily during pregnancy and postpartum. During the second week postpartum, a breastmilk primidone level was 6 mg/L, which was 50% of her serum level. Primidone metabolites were not measured.[1] Twelve primidone breastmilk levels were measured between days 3 and 32 postpartum at unstated times after the dose in an unstated number of women who were taking primidone and other anticonvulsants in unstated dosages. Primidone levels averaged 2.3 mg/L (range 0.8 to 2.8 mg/L), while maternal serum levels averaged 2.8 mg/L.[2] An epileptic woman was taking primidone 1 gram daily and carbamazepine 1 gram daily during pregnancy and postpartum. At 5 weeks postpartum, a milk sample was measured. The milk fat contained 11 mg/L while the skimmed portion contained 9.1 mg/L of primidone. At the same time, phenobarbital levels in milk fat and skimmed milk were 11.2 and 11.4 mg/L, respectively.[3] Four mothers taking an average dosage of 7.3 mg/kg daily of primidone had breastmilk levels measured of primidone and its metabolites at various times during days 4 to 27 days postpartum. One of the mothers was also taking valproic acid. Average milk levels were as follows: primidone 4.2 mg/L, PEMA 2 mg/L, and phenobarbital 2.8 mg/L. One mother also had 3 hydroxyphenobarbital levels averaging 0.3 mg/L reported.[4] Using the total of all the drug and metabolite levels, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 18.5% of the maternal-weight-adjusted dosage. Infant Levels:  An infant whose epileptic mother was taking primidone 625 mg, phenobarbital 100 mg, phenytoin 200 mg and sulthiame 200 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum was partially breastfed. At 17 days of age, the phenobarbital serum level was 2 mg/L. The proportion of breastfeeding was increased, and at 1 month of age, the infant's serum phenobarbital level was 12.7 mg/L. Breastfeeding continued, but by 2 months of age, the serum phenobarbital concentration was 1 mg/L.[5] The mother of a fully breastfed infant was taking primidone 825 mg daily at birth; dosage was decreased in steps to 625 mg daily at 14 days postpartum and then to 325 mg daily at 1 month of age. The infant's steady-state levels were primidone 2.5 mg/L, PEMA 1.4 mg/L and phenobarbital 10 mg/L during this time. Another mother taking primidone 500 mg daily during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The infant's steady-state levels were primidone 0.7 mg/L, PEMA 0.4 mg/L and phenobarbital 2 mg/L during the first 30 days postpartum.[6] In a series of 9 mothers who were taking primidone (dosages not reported) during the first week postpartum, the average milk level was 8.4 mg/L (range 5.2 to 13.7 mg/L) which averaged 115% (range 44 to 228%) of their serum levels. Five of the mothers had phenobarbital levels milk levels measured. Milk levels averaged 6.6 mg/L or 37% of their serum levels.[7]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "An infant death occurred from overlying and suffocation by a parent during sleep. Sedation from primidone, phenobarbital and phenytoin in breastmilk was possibly a contributing factor. Phenobarbital was found in the infant's serum (8 mg/L) and liver (16 mcg/g) on autopsy.[8] An epileptic mother was taking primidone 250 mg 3 times daily and valproic acid 2.4 g daily during pregnancy and postpartum. During the second week postpartum, her breastfed infant was sedated. Breastfeeding was stopped and the drowsiness cleared.[1] The sedation was possibly caused by primidone in breastmilk. A woman taking primidone 1 g daily and carbamazepine 1 g daily during pregnancy and postpartum breastfed her infant for 5 weeks and noted no difference in the infant's activity before and after nursing.[3] A probable case of drug-induced drowsiness occurred in a newborn whose mother was taking primidone, carbamazepine and phenytoin (dosages not stated). At day 30, breastfeeding was discontinued because of the drowsiness that occurred after each feeding and poor weight gain. These authors also found that 15 partially breastfed infants whose mothers were taking anticonvulsants, including primidone, gained weight at a slower rate during the first 5 days postpartum than did 75 infants of epileptic mothers who bottle fed or control mothers taking no medications.[9]Possible drug-related drowsiness, pallor and feeding difficulties were reported in a 4-day-old whose mother was taking primidone 625 mg, phenobarbital 100 mg, phenytoin 200 mg and sulthiame 200 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. Nasogastric feeding was required for 5 weeks, during with time the infant continued to be partially breastfed.[5] In a cohort study of women who were taking primidone during pregnancy and their infants, 7 infants had withdrawal symptoms after birth. Of these infants, one was partially breastfed and the rest were not breastfed. In contrast, five infants who were breastfed did not have withdrawal symptoms.[6] Sedation lasting 5 weeks after birth and a lack of weight gain for 4 weeks after birth were reported in the exclusively breastfed infant of a mother who was taking primidone 11.4 mg/kg daily, valproic acid 13.6 mg/kg daily, and ethosuximide 11.4 mg/kg daily during pregnancy and postpartum.[10] The reaction was possibly caused by primidone in breastmilk. A breastfed infant whose mother was taking primidone 375 mg, phenobarbital 90 mg, and carbamazepine 800 mg daily did well despite a saliva phenobarbital level of 3.4 mg/L. At 7 months of age, after the mother abruptly stop nursing, the infant had a number of \"startle reactions\"and infantile seizures occurred which were confirmed by an abnormal electroencephalogram. Continued phenobarbital administration to the infant for 15 months controlled the seizures and no more occurred up to 5 years of age.[11]A woman with long-standing seizure disorder was taking primidone and levetiracetam became pregnant. The dosage of her medications were reduced during pregnancy to provide a primidone (phenobarbital) serum concentration of 3.4 mg/L and a levetiracetam serum concentration of 40.5 mg/L. The mother was instructed to discontinue breastfeeding after 3 days. The following day her infant developed withdrawal seizures. After reinstituting breastfeeding, the infant's seizures stopped and did not recur. The infant had no abnormal findings and was thriving and seizure free at 6 months of age.[12]"

Most of these reports occurred in older studies in which sedating agents such as phenobarbital and primidone were used.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Maternal use of oral narcotics during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, central nervous system depression and even death. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of propoxyphene may be particularly prone to causing these effects. Propoxyphene should be avoided during breastfeeding.[1]"
    drug_levels: "Propoxyphene is metabolized to active norpropoxyphene (25%) and to several inactive metabolites. Norpropoxyphene has a 30 to 36 hour half-life. The oral bioavailability of norpropoxyphene is unknown. Propoxyphene is available in 2 salt forms: 65 mg of the hydrochloride form is equivalent to 100 mg of the napsylate. Maternal Levels: Six breastfeeding mothers, 5 in the first few days postcesarean section and 1 at 10 months postpartum were given oral propoxyphene hydrochloride 130 mg once then 65 mg every 4 hours for 16 hours for a cumulative dose of 390 mg. Breastmilk propoxyphene was measured at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 hours after the last dose. Propoxyphene peak levels occurred at 3 hours while norpropoxyphene levels remained fairly constant. An average propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene milk level over the 8-hour collection period was calculated for each patient and varied substantially among patients (range 24 to 210 mcg/L for propoxyphene and 54 to 606 mcg/L for norpropoxyphene). Norpropoxyphene had a longer maternal plasma half-life and thus accumulated in breastmilk more so than propoxyphene. Greater breastmilk production was associated with higher milk levels of both propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene.[2][3] Using the highest average milk propoxyphene level in this study, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 32 mcg/kg daily of propoxyphene and 91 mcg/kg daily of norpropoxyphene, equivalent to about 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In a case-control study of 12 breastfed term newborns with unexplained episodes of apnea, bradycardia or cyanosis during the first week of life, maternal oral propoxyphene use was determined to be the probable cause. A higher proportion of newborns with episodes, 83 compared to 31%, had mothers using opiates, including propoxyphene, for postpartum analgesia. The mean number of doses taken was also higher with mothers of affected newborns taking a mean of 10 doses (range 4 to 22) compared to 5 doses (range 1 to 13) in the control group.[4] A fullterm breastfed infant had mild hypotonia and nursing poorly at 10 days of age; the infant had not regained her birth weight by this time. By 7 days later, the mother had less milk and stopped nursing. The infant's mother had been prescribed 6 capsules daily of propoxyphene 30 mg plus acetaminophen 500 mg for the first 10 days postpartum. Hair samples from the infant were positive for propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene and were higher than the mother's hair sample concentrations.[5] Propoxyphene was probably the cause of the adverse reactions in the infant. All adverse reactions in breastfed infants reported in France between January 1985 and June 2011 were compiled by a French pharmacovigilance center. Of 174 reports, propoxyphene was reported to cause adverse reactions in 11 infants and to be one of the drugs most often suspected in serious adverse reactions. Reactions included hypotonia, apnea, respiratory distress, bradycardia, constipation and weight loss.[6]"

It also has poor oral bioavailability, further decreasing infant exposure to the drug. Some authors have suggested that withholding breastfeeding for 8 hours after a single subcutaneous injection would virtually eliminate infant exposure to the drug.[1] This maneuver might be helpful in extreme cases, such as in the mother of a preterm infant, but sumatriptan would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in most breastfed infants. One anecdotal report of lactation ceasing after a single injection of sumatriptan has not been verified."

Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. Three women were taking oral topiramate daily. One taking 150 mg daily had an average milk level of 2.3 mg/L on day 24 postpartum. A mother taking 200 mg daily had average milk levels of 4.8 mg/L on day 20 postpartum and 4.6 mg/L on day 97 postpartum. The third woman who was taking 200 mg daily had average milk level 610 mcg/L on day 14 postpartum and 1.2 mg/L on day 27 postpartum. The authors estimated that the infants received doses between 0.1 and 0.7 mg/kg/day which was between 3 and 23% of the mother's weight-adjusted dose.[1]A woman was taking 175 mg of topiramate daily. On day 12 postpartum, her dose was reduced to 150 mg daily and 4 hours after the dose, her milk topiramate concentration was 3.1 mg/L.[2] A nursing mother was taking 100 mg of topiramate daily. Topiramate was detected in breastmilk at a concentration of 5.3 mg/L at an unspecified time with respect to the dose. The authors estimated that the infant might have received 35% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage, although their calculation method is unclear.[3] Using the milk level of 5.3 mg/L, the infant would have received 56% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Infant Levels: Three infants were breastfed from birth while their mothers were taking oral topiramate for epilepsy. Serum levels in a 24-day-old infant whose mother was taking 150 mg daily were about 475 mcg/L. Another infant whose mother was taking 200 mg daily had an average serum level of 594 mcg/L at 20 days of age and 713 mcg/L at 97 days of age. A third infant whose mother was taking 200 mg daily had undetectable (  < 305 mcg/L) serum levels at 14 and 27 days of age.

She took a daily dosage of 150 to 175 mg for the first 6 months, then 200 mg daily. At 1 year of age, the infant was developing normally and both parents stated that no side effects such as tiredness had been observed in the infant.[2] A woman who took topiramate 300 mg daily throughout pregnancy delivered a normal, healthy infant. She reportedly breastfed her infant exclusively for 8 months at which time no adverse drug effects or neurodevelopmental delay were noted by the infant's pediatrician.[6]The breastfed infant of a mother who was taking 100 mg of topiramate daily developed watery, foamy stools with 8 to 10 bowel movements daily at 40 days of age. The infant's rate of weight gain also declined. Topiramate was detected in breastmilk at a relatively high concentration. Two weeks later, breastfeeding was discontinued. Within 24 hours, the stool frequency declined to 2 to 3 times daily, more solid and the color and odor normalized.[3] Topiramate was the probable cause of the diarrhea in the infant."

Specific milk concentrations are not given, but milk levels were 50 to 10% of maternal serum levels, consistent with other studies. The authors estimated that a breastfed infant would receive only 6 mg in a liter of milk.[11] Four mothers taking valproic acid (3 took 1.2 grams daily and 1 took 1.8 grams daily) during pregnancy and postpartum had breastmilk levels measured during the first week postpartum. The average breastmilk levels were 1.8 mg/L (range 1 to 3.8 mg/L).[12] One woman taking valproic acid 1 gram daily had milk levels of 3, 2.3 and 1.4 mg/L on postpartum days 6, 7, and 17, respectively. Another woman was taking valproic acid 1.4 gram plus carbamazepine 600 mg and diazepam 2 mg daily. Milk valproate levels were 2, 1.4, 3.5, 2.3 and 2.8 mg/L on postpartum days 1, 3, 15, 29, and 43, respectively.[13] Infant Levels: The breastfed infant of an epileptic mother who was taking valproic acid 1.6 grams daily in divided doses had serum valproic acid level of about 7.5 mg/L on day 5 of life that fell to undetectable levels by day 29.[4] A 2-month-old breastfed infant was nursed by a mother taking valproic acid 250 mg twice daily. Infant serum levels were undetectable (  < 0.3 mg/L) before nursing and reached a peak of 14 mg/L 30 minutes after nursing which was 2 hours after the mother's dose.

A 1-month-old infant had a serum valproate level of 4 mg/L during maternal therapy with 750 mg daily in divided doses. Another fully breastfed 3-month-old whose mother was taking 250 mg of valproic acid twice daily had a serum level of 1 mg/L.[15] Two breastfed infants whose mothers were taking valproic acid 500 mg daily for bipolar disorder had undetectable (  < 3.5 and   < 5 mcg/L) serum valproate levels. Both mothers were also taking clonazepam; one was also taking trifluoperazine and the other was taking fluoxetine.[16]Four exclusively breastfed infants whose mothers began taking valproic acid monotherapy postpartum in dosages of 750 or 1000 mg daily had average serum levels of 1 mg/L which averaged 1.8% of their mothers' serum levels. Another infant that was 80% breastfed during maternal treatment with 1 gram daily had a serum level of 0.7 mg/L or 1% of the maternal serum level. A sixth infant that was 50% breastfed during maternal treatment with 1 gram daily had a serum level of 0.7 mg/L or 1.2% of the maternal serum level.

Petechiae, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and mild hematuria occurred in a 2.5-month-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking valproic acid 600 mg twice daily. Blood hemoglobin and reticulocytes normalized between 12 and 19 days after discontinuing breastfeeding. The petechiae resolved 35 days after discontinuing breastfeeding and the infant's platelet count had almost reached the normal range by this time. By day 83, the infant's platelet count was well within the normal range. The authors believed the adverse effect to be caused by valproic acid in breastmilk.[14] However, other authors believe that these symptoms were more likely caused by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura following a viral infection.[17] Two breastfed infants aged 1 and 3 months whose mothers were taking valproic acid monotherapy 750 and 500 mg daily developed normally and had no abnormal laboratory values. Their plasma levels were 6% and 1.5% or their mother's serum levels, respectively.[15] Six breastfed infants whose mothers were taking valproic acid 750 or 1000 mg daily had no adverse reactions to valproic acid in breastmilk.[17] An exclusively breastfed infants whose mother was taking valproate 1.8 g, topiramate 300 mg, and levetiracetam 2 g, daily during pregnancy and lactation appeared healthy to the investigators throughout the 6- to 8-week study period.[19] In a long-term study on infants exposed to anticonvulsants during breastfeeding, no difference in average intelligence quotient at 3 years of age was found between infants who were breastfed (n = 11) a median of 6 months and those not breastfed (n = 24) when their mothers were taking valproate monotherapy.[20] At 6 years of age, extensive psychological and intelligence testing found that the breastfed infants had higher IQ values than the nonbreastfed infants.[2] A prospective cohort study in Norway followed infants of mothers who took antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and lactation and compared to infants with mothers with untreated epilepsy and infants with fathers who took antiepileptics as control groups Of the 223 mothers studied, 27 were taking valproate monotherapy. Infants were assessed at 6, 18 and 36 months of age. Continuous breastfeeding in children of women using antiepileptic drugs was associated with no greater impaired development than those with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for less than 6 months.[21][22] A woman with bipolar disorder who delivered twins and was taking sodium valproate in a therapeutic dosage was started on quetiapine 200 mg and olanzapine 15 mg at 11 pm daily after 20 days postpartum. She withheld breastfeeding during the night and discarded milk pumped at 7 am. She then breastfed her infants until 11 pm. The mother continued feeding the infants on this schedule for 15 months. Monthly follow-up of the infants indicated normal growth and neither the pediatricians nor the parents noted any adverse effects in the infants.[23]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited information indicates that maternal doses of zonisamide up to 400 mg daily produce high levels in milk and infant serum, but serum levels in neonates decrease during the first month of life while nursing. Although no adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants, the number of infants reported have been small. Alternative drugs are preferred, but if it must be given, monitor the infant for drowsiness, adequate weight gain, and developmental milestones, especially in younger or exclusively breastfed infants and when using combinations of anticonvulsant drugs. Some clinicians recommend that mothers taking zonisamide only partially breastfeed in order to reduce the exposure of the infant to the drug and to consider monitoring infants' serum zonisamide concentrations.[1]"
    drug_levels: "In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels. A woman took zonisamide monotherapy (dosage and regimen not specified) during pregnancy and postpartum. Two serum concentration were measured: 13.6 mg/L at 3 hours before delivery and 23.2 mg/L on day 17 postpartum. Milk samples were collected postpartum and measured for zonisamide using untreated breastmilk in an enzyme immunoassay. Milk levels were 4.6 mg/L at 58 hours postpartum, 13.6 at 61 hours postpartum, and 19.2 mg/L at 77 hours postpartum.[2] A mother was taking oral zonisamide 300 mg daily. Milk levels measured 1.5 hours after her dose on days 6 and 30 postpartum were 9.75 and 10.5 mg/L, respectively. Milk levels measured 2.5 hours after her dose on days 3 and 15 postpartum were 8.25 and 9.12 mg/L, respectively.[3] The same authors reported that \"patients\" (number and time postpartum unspecified) taking oral zonisamide 300 mg daily had an average (+/- SD) breastmilk level of 9.41 +/- 0.95 mg/L.[4] These values are exactly the same as the average and standard deviation of the former patient's 4 milk levels. It is likely that these results are merely a duplicate of the above results.A mother who was taking oral zonisamide 400 mg, carbamazepine 1 g, and clonazepam 1 mg daily had breastmilk whey levels of zonisamide measured 9 times from day 1 to day 10 postpartum. All of the levels were distributed (neither increasing nor decreasing) in the range of 8.9 to 10.9 mg/L.[5] Using data from the 2 patients with relatively complete information on dosage and milk levels,[2][4] the average amounts in milk represent an infant dosage of about 23 to 28% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.In one report, two mothers took zonisamide during pregnancy and breastfeeding. One mother was taking 300 mg (6.2 mg/kg) zonisamide daily as 100 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening. On days 4 and 5 postpartum, milk zonisamide levels were 16.2 mg/L at 10 hours after a 100 mg dose and 18 mg/L at 12.5 hours after a 200 mg dose. Using the larger value, the authors estimated the maximum infant dosage to be 2.7 mg/kg daily corresponding to 44% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage. Another woman was taking 100 mg (2.1 mg/kg) of zonisamide daily. On day 3 postpartum, a trough milk levels was 3.4 mg/L; on day 5, a level taken at 4.5 hours after the dose (approximately the peak) was 5.1 mg/L. Using the larger value,  the authors estimated the maximum infant dosage to be 0.77 mg/kg daily corresponding to 36% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage.[1] Infant Levels: The serum zonisamide levels were measured in a breastfed infant whose mother was taking zonisamide 400 mg, carbamazepine 1 g, and clonazepam 1 mg daily. In this infant and in another breastfed infant whose mother was taking zonisamide 400 mg and carbamazepine 800 mg daily, high transplacentally acquired plasma levels of about 14 and 11 mg/L, respectively, fell over a 6- to 7-day monitoring period despite intake via breastmilk. The first infant's plasma level on day 24 was 3.9 mg/L.[5] An infant whose mother was taking zonisamide (dose not specified) during pregnancy and breastfeeding had a serum zonisamide concentration that was 3.6 mg/L or 17% of the maternal serum concentration at 9 days postpartum. The half-life of zonisamide in this infant and one other was estimated to be about 100 hours.[6]An infant whose mother was taking zonisamide 300 mg (6.2 mg/kg) daily was exclusively breastfed for 9 days postpartum, then breastfed twice daily and supplemented with formula 7 to 8 times daily, resulting in an estimated zonisamide dose of 0.54 mg/kg daily or 8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. At birth, the infant's serum zonisamide concentration was 14.4 mg/L, but on day 34 postpartum, zonisamide was undetectable (  < 0.5 mg/L) in the infant's serum.[1]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A patient taking zonisamide 300 mg orally 3 times daily as well as other unspecified antipsychotics was followed at 0, 3, 14 and 30 days postpartum. Her infant exhibited no behavioral problems.[3] Two infants were breastfed postpartum by their mothers. One was exclusively breastfed for 9 days postpartum, then breastfed twice daily and supplemented with formula 7 to 8 times daily. The maternal zonisamide dose was 300 mg (6.2 mg/kg) daily. On day 34, the infant was healthy, had gained weight and had experienced no observable adverse effects. The second infant was partially breastfed by a mother taking zonisamide 100 mg (2.1 mg/kg) daily. No adverse reactions were noted in the infant during the first 2 weeks postpartum, at which time breastfeeding was discontinued because of a low milk supply.[1]"

Four received an immediate-release product 40 to 80 mg daily, and 6 received a sustained-release product 100 to 150 mg daily. Another woman received intravenous nicardipine 120 mg daily. The authors calculated that the infants received an average of 0.073% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose with the oral dosage and 0.14%  of the maternal weight-adjusted dose with the intravenous dosage. They estimated that the average dosage that an infant would receive is about 0.3% of the projected infant dosage.[1] Seven women received intravenous infusions of nicardipine for an average of 1.9 days in the immediate postpartum period as therapy for pre-eclampsia. Thirty-four milk samples were obtained at unspecified times; nicardipine was undetectable (  < 5 mcg/L) in 82% of samples. Four women receiving 1 to 6.5 mg/hour of nicardipine had 6 milk samples with detectable nicardipine ranging from 5.1 to 18.5 mcg/L. The highest concentration of 18.5 mcg/L was found in a woman receiving 5.5 mg/hour of nicardipine. The authors estimated that the maximum dose that could be received by a breastfed infant was less than 0.3 mcg daily or between 0.015 to 0.004% of a therapeutic dose in a 1 kg infant.[2] Eighteen women with severe preeclampsia were given continuous infusion of nicardipine to control their blood pressure during pregnancy and postpartum. Blood and breastmilk samples were taken between 2 and 7 days postpartum from 17 of the women. The median postpartum nicardipine dosage was 0.54 mg/kg daily (mean 0.26 0.54 mg/kg daily; range 0.43 to 1.63 mg/kg daily). The median breastmilk nicardipine concentration in milk was 4.7 mcg/L (mean 6.9 mcg/L; range 2.3 to 37.7 mcg/L). Milk nicardipine levels were proportional to maternal plasma levels.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: In 20 mothers in the immediate postpartum period given oral trimethoprim, peak milk levels occurred 3 hours after the dose. In 14 of these women who received a daily dosage of 320 mg, the peak milk level averaged 2.4 mg/L and the trough averaged 1 mg/L. In 6 other women who received a daily dosage of 480 mg, the peak milk level averaged 4 mg/L and the trough averaged 1.5 mg/L. The authors calculated that a breastfed infant would receive a daily dosage of 0.75 mg with a maternal dosage of 320 mg daily and 1.7 mg with a maternal dosage of 480 mg.[1][2] Forty women in the early postpartum period received oral co-trimoxazole and had milk levels measured several times daily for 5 days. After trimethoprim doses of 320 mg daily, average milk levels were about 2 mg/L. Milk levels increased to about 3 mg/L by day 5 of therapy. In 10 other women who received trimethoprim 480 mg daily, average milk levels were only slightly higher.[3]With the usual dose of trimethoprim 320 mg daily, an exclusively breastfed infant would be expected to receive 0.45 mg/kg daily of trimethoprim.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Evidence on the safety and desirability of using combined oral contraceptives during lactation ranges in quality from poor to fair.[1][2][3]<br><br>  The weight of current evidence seems to indicate that combination oral contraceptives probably do not affect the composition of milk substantially in healthy, well-nourished mothers and do not adversely affect long-term infant growth and development. Combined oral contraceptives might transiently affect growth negatively during the first month after introduction. The magnitude of the effect on lactation likely depends on the dose and the time of introduction postpartum. Ethinyl estradiol in doses greater than 30 mcg daily can suppress lactation and lead to more supplementation and possibly earlier discontinuation of breastfeeding than nonhormonal or progestin-only contraception. Additionally, introduction of an estrogen before 3 weeks postpartum may increase the risk of thromboembolism in postpartum women. Rare cases of reversible breast enlargement in breastfed infants have been reported, mostly with estrogen doses higher than are currently used.<br><br> Based on the available evidence, expert opinion in the United States holds that because of the clotting risk, combination contraceptive products should not be used before 3 weeks postpartum. Between 3 weeks and 6 months postpartum, the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks, although the evidence of lack of effect on lactation is poor and does not include preterm or ill infants. After 6 months postpartum, combination contraceptives, including oral tablets, the transdermal patch and vaginal ring, can be used, but progestin-only methods are preferred if breastfeeding will be continued.[4] World Health Organization guidelines are more restrictive, stating that combined oral contraceptives should not be used in nursing mothers before 42 days postpartum and the disadvantages of using the method generally outweigh the advantages between 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum.[5]"
    drug_levels: "Combination contraceptives contain an estrogen and a progestin. Ethinyl estradiol is the most commonly used estrogen. Mestranol is an ethinyl estradiol pro-drug; 80 mcg of mestranol is equivalent to 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. The progestins are primarily 19-nor testosterone derivatives such as levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethindrone and norethinodrel. They have varying degrees of androgenic activity. Maternal Levels: Studies that measured ethinyl estradiol in breastmilk are reported here. Studies that reported progestin levels in milk (e.g., levonorgestrel, norethindrone) can be found in the records of those drugs. Four women who were fully nursing their infants were given a contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol 50 mcg and megestrol acetate 4 mg beginning at 2 months postpartum. Another 4 women who were 6 to 18 months postpartum were given a single dose of 500 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. After 10 days of therapy, ethinyl estradiol was undetectable (  < 50 ng/L) in the milk of women who received the 50 mcg dose at several times after the dose. In those who receive 500 mcg, peak milk levels usually were found in the 3-hour sample although the peak was found in the 7-hour sample in one. Peak milk levels ranged from about 170 to 300 ng/L; levels dropped rapidly and were usually undetectable by 23 hours after the dose. Based on the higher dose, the authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant whose mother was taking 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol daily would receive a dose of about 10 ng daily.[6] Milk was collected and pooled from 2 groups of women who were taking ethinyl estradiol 100 mcg 3 times daily either immediately postpartum or after 1 to 6 months postpartum. Milk samples were collected 2 hours after the dose. Pooled milk was bioassayed for estrogenic activity and compared with the milk from lactating mothers taking no exogenous estrogens whose milk was collected at various times postpartum. No estrogenic activity was detected (  < 10 ng/80 mL of pooled milk [  < 0.125 mcg/L]) from women taking ethinyl estradiol above background estrogenic activity found in control colostrum.[7] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Bilateral breast enlargement was reported in a 3-week-old male breastfed infant whose mother began taking an oral contraceptive containing norethynodrel 2.5 mg and mestranol 100 mcg on day 3 postpartum. On the second cycle, she began taking norethynodrel 5 mg and mestranol 75 mcg in error and the breast enlargement became more pronounced. After discontinuation of breastfeeding, the breasts returned to normal within 2 to 3 weeks.[8] The contraceptive probably caused the breast enlargement. Bilateral breast enlargement occurred in an otherwise normal 3-month-old male infant whose mother began a combination contraceptive containing 100 mcg of ethinyl estradiol for 21 days with the last 6 days also containing 5 mg of norethindrone. The woman stopped the contraception and the gynecomastia disappeared completely in about 4 weeks.[9] The contraceptive possibly caused the breast enlargement. In a study of women given a combination of 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 250 mcg of levonorgestrel, an infant (sex not stated) developed transient gynecomastia after 3 months of maternal therapy.[6] The contraceptive possibly caused the breast enlargement. An 18-month old partially breastfed girl developed bilateral breast enlargement 3 months after her mother began taking an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg and levonorgestrel 150 mcg. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the breast enlargement decreased over the next 6 months. The girl was growing and developing normally at 7 years of age.[10]The contraceptive possibly caused the breast enlargement. A 10-month-old male infant presented after 3 weeks of vomiting, diarrhea and deterioration in nutritional status. Laboratory evaluation found folic acid deficiency and macrocytic anemia which responded well to folic acid. The mother had been taking a combination oral contraceptive (ingredients not specified) for 3 months. The authors attributed the folic acid deficiency to maternal contraceptive use.[11] The contraceptive possibly caused the folate deficiency. Forty-eight children (20 boys and 28 girls) whose mothers used a combination oral contraceptive containing 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol during lactation beginning 2 months postpartum were compared to age- and sex-matched control children whose mothers breastfed, but took no contraceptive. Using several different sources of health records, no differences in the height or weight, illnesses, or intellectual development of the groups at several time points were found up to 8 years of age.[12]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "High-dose estrogens, alone or in combination with an androgen, were formerly used to suppress lactation in women who did not wish to breastfeed.[13] Combination oral contraceptives containing mestranol 100 mcg daily has also been used as a method for decreasing postpartum breast engorgement in women who did not breastfeed.[14][15] In a randomized, double-blind study, 2 tablets twice daily for 5 days of a combination oral contraceptive containing 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol had similar efficacy to bromocriptine (dosage not stated) in suppressing postpartum breast engorgement and lactation.[16] Changes in milk composition of breastmilk (total and nonprotein nitrogen, alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, and albumin) have been observed in women taking various combination contraceptives containing 30 to 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel 150 to 250 mcg or megesterol acetate 4 mg. However, the changes were generally within the normal range of values for healthy women.[17] Similar results were reported by another group with similar combined contraceptives.[18] Another study found no clinically important changes in the composition in the milk of mothers taking a combination contraceptive containing 150 mcg of levonorgestrel and 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol starting at 6 weeks postpartum. However, milk volume was decreased compared to women who used no hormonal contraception.[19][20] In a partially randomized study, 25 postpartum women who want to breastfeed their infants were given an oral contraceptive containing mestranol 80 mcg and norethindrone 1 mg daily starting 6 weeks postpartum. The duration of lactation and the weight gain of the breastfed infants was reduced among the mothers who received the contraceptive compared to 25 mothers randomized to received a placebo or who took no tablets.[21] In a double-blind trial (randomization not stated), mothers were given either placebo (n = 218) or a combination oral contraceptive containing mestranol 50 mcg and norethindrone 1 mg (n = 233) daily from the day after birth to day 8 postpartum. Although there was no difference in the percentage of mothers breastfeeding, women taking the active drug needed to provide supplementary feedings more frequently than placebo-treated patients (12% vs 3.5%). The authors concluded that mothers wishing to breastfeed should not receive this contraceptive.[22] A nonrandomized study compared 100 women who were 4 to 24 weeks postpartum and were given a combination contraceptive containing mestranol 100 mcg and ethynodiol diacetate 1 mg to women who chose not to use oral contraception. Women who received the contraceptive produced less milk per week than control mothers in the 8 weeks after beginning the contraceptive.[23] An observational report on 83 women who were given 1 of 9 combination oral contraceptives containing 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 80 to 100 mcg of mestranol starting at 5 days postpartum found that 54% were still breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum. This was in comparison to 59% of women who were not taking an oral contraceptive. The authors noted that some mothers who wished to breastfeed had difficulty.[24] Because of the overall low breastfeeding rates, lack of randomization and high loss to follow-up, the results of this study are questionable. In a randomized trial, 367 women receiving one of several methods of hormonal contraception and 249 women receiving nonhormonal contraception. Women receiving combination contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol 50 mcg and norethindrone 1 mg beginning 1 month postpartum had a median duration of lactation shorter than control mothers who used no contraception (5.3 vs 4.6 months), but the difference was not statistically significant. Women who used oral contraceptives containing mestranol had a statistically shorter duration of lactation than those using nonhormal contraception.[25] One nonrandomized study of 6 women found that daily use of a combination contraceptive containing 10 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 350 mcg of norethindrone experienced decreases in protein, lipids, calcium and phosphorus compared to 11 women who received nonhormonal contraception. However these changes were not statistically significant. Milk volume was similar in the two groups.[26] One group of investigators studied lactational performance in a randomized controlled trial of fully nursing mothers given an oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel 150 mcg and ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg daily beginning at 30 to 35 days postpartum. Comparison groups were mothers who received no hormonal contraception. Of the mothers evaluated at 91 days postpartum (contraceptive n = 103; placebo n = 188), the contraceptive group had a lower percentage of exclusively breastfeeding mothers (81% vs 92%) and lower average daily infant weight gain during the first month of use and lower absolute weights at 61 and 91 days compared to the control groups.[27] The negative effect of the hormonal contraceptives continued to be seen during postpartum months 4 to 10. Infant weight gain was lower than that of control women who used the lactation amenorrhea method, but not compared to women who used an IUD.[28] The same group studied the same contraceptive in 59 mothers compared to 82 mothers using nonhormonal contraception all of whom were fully breastfeeding at 90 days postpartum. The oral contraceptive was initiated at 90 to 95 days postpartum. At all times from months 6 to 12 postpartum, the percentage of fully breastfed infants in the oral contraceptive group was lower and the percentage of infants receiving supplements was greater, although the average time of complete weaning did not differ between the groups. During the first month of therapy, infants whose mothers were taking the oral contraceptive gained weight at a lower rate than those in the nonhormonal group. However, the absolute weights of the infants were not significantly different at 12 months postpartum.[29] The authors concluded that low-dose combination contraceptives are not a good choice during breastfeeding and that if they are used, they should be instituted as late as possible, and particularly not during the first month postpartum. In a multicenter, double-blind study, well-nourished women wishing hormonal contraception were randomized to contraceptive containing 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg of levonorgestrel (n = 86) or 75 mcg of racemic norgestrel (n = 85) beginning at 6 weeks postpartum. One hundred eleven women who received either no or nonhormonal contraception comprised the control group. Infant growth and maternal milk volume were measured periodically up to 24 weeks postpartum. The decline in milk volume was statistically significantly greater at all time periods from week 6 to 24 for the combined oral contraceptive group (42% vs 17% in the control group and 12% with progestin-only tablets). No differences were seen between groups in average infant growth. The authors concluded that low-dose combined oral contraceptives can be used in well-nourished mothers postpartum, but that they should be warned that their milk volume might be decreased.[30] A case-control study compared the children of 48 women who used a combination oral contraceptive containing 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol during lactation beginning at 2 months postpartum. There was a statistically significant difference in the duration of lactation between the contraceptive users and nonusers, 3.7 and 4.6 months, respectively.[12] A retrospective cohort study compared 371 women who received high-dose estrogen (either 3 mg of diethylstilbestrol or 150 mcg of ethinyl estradiol daily) during adolescence for adult height reduction to 409 women who did not receive estrogen. No difference in breastfeeding duration was found between the two groups, indicating that high-dose estrogen during adolescence has no effect on later breastfeeding.[31] A prospective, nonrandomized trial compared 4 contraceptives in 10 women each to assess their effect on milk production. One of the following were begun on day 42 postpartum as chosen by the mother: combined ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg plus levonorgestrel 150 mcg (Microvlar), etonogestrel implant (Implanon), levonorgestrel intrauterine system (Myrena), or a copper IUD (Optima). Milk intake was measured using deuterium oxide given to the mother and measured in the infants' saliva as well as numbers of wet diapers per day. Infants were also weighed and measured to assess growth. No differences in milk intake or infant growth were observed between the methods from days 42 through 63.[32]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited information on the use of estradiol during breastfeeding indicates that the route of administration and dosage form have influences on the amount transferred into breastmilk. Vaginal administration results in measurable amounts in milk, but transdermal patches do not. Maternal doses of up to 200 mcg daily transdermally do not increase estradiol or estriol in breastfed infants or cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. Vaginal administration results in unpredictable peak times for estradiol in breastmilk, so timing of the dose with respect to breastfeeding is probably not useful.<br><br>  A case report of inadequate milk production and inadequate infant weight gain was possibly caused by transdermal estradiol initiated on the first day postpartum, but 2 small studies found no such effect when the drug was initiated after lactation was well established."

In 3 of the 6 women, peak milk levels occurred 3 hours after the dose. In 2 others, the peak level occurred 7 hours after the dose and in the sixth, the peak occurred 11 hours after the dose. Peak milk levels were about 100 ng/L in 4 women, in one it was 300 ng/L and in the sixth, it was 1000 ng/L.[1] Twenty-one women who were 20 weeks postpartum and breastfeeding their infants were randomized to receive a transdermal patch that released estradiol 50 mcg (n = 7), 75 mcg (n = 5)  or 100 mcg (n = 6) daily or placebo (n = 4) for 2 weeks. Breastmilk and serum samples were collected at the beginning and end of the study. Serum estradiol levels increased slightly from baseline, but the differences were not statistically significant; serum levels were in the range of 25 to 45 ng/L. Estradiol was undetectable (  < 6.8 ng/L) in all breastmilk samples.[2] Infant Levels. Six nursing mothers received transdermal estradiol as part of a study comparing estradiol to sertraline and placebo for postpartum depression. The mothers received estradiol dosages between 50 and 200 mcg daily (mean 133 mcg daily) at the time of serum level analysis at 4 and 8 weeks of therapy. Four of the 6 infants were exclusively breastfed and the other two were more than 50% breastfed. All infants had undetectable (  < 2.5 ng/L) serum estriol concentrations and 4 of the 6 had undetectable (  < 2.5 ng/L) serum estradiol concentrations. The other two had estradiol concentrations of 7 and 7.1 ng/L.

At 11 days of age, the infant was jaundiced and had gained only 60 grams since birth. With more frequent nursing, weight gain improved, but remained inadequate until day 28 when the estradiol was discontinued. The infant then experienced above average weight gain through day 66 postpartum. The delayed and reduced weight gain was possibly caused by estradiol.[4] Six nursing mothers received transdermal estradiol as part of a study comparing estradiol to sertraline and placebo for postpartum depression. The mothers received estradiol dosages between 50 and 200 mcg daily (mean 133 mcg daily) at the time of serum level analysis at 4 and 8 weeks of therapy.

An additional control group received no patches. The number of breast feeds per day decreased in all groups over the course of the study, but there were no important differences among the groups.[6] A retrospective cohort study compared 371 women who received high-dose estrogen (either 3 mg of diethylstilbestrol or 150 mcg of ethinyl estradiol daily) during adolescence for adult height reduction to 409 women who did not receive estrogen.

Those with an interest in a combination oral contraceptive should consult the record entitled, \"Contraceptives, Oral, Combined.\"<br><br>  Although nonhormonal methods are preferred during breastfeeding, progestin-only contraceptives such as levonorgestrel are considered the hormonal contraceptives of choice during lactation. Fair quality evidence indicates that levonorgestrel does not adversely affect the composition of milk, the growth and development of the infant or the milk supply. Expert opinion in the United States holds that the risks of progestin-only contraceptive products usually are acceptable for nursing mothers at any time postpartum.[1] The World Health Association recommends introduction of progestin-only contraceptives at 6 weeks postpartum.[2] Some evidence indicates that progestin-only contraceptives may offer protection against bone mineral density loss during lactation, or at least do not exacerbate it.[3][4][5]<br><br>  The levonorgestrel IUD (Myrena) is recommended to be inserted at least 6 weeks postpartum and in some cases up to 12 weeks postpartum when uterine involution is complete. However, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology considers earlier insertion to be appropriate based on expert opinion.[6] Two small, randomized studies on this point differed in their outcomes. One found that early insertion did not adversely affect breastfeeding,[7] and the other found that immediate IUD insertion markedly reduced the breastfeeding rate at 6 months postpartum.[8] One large European cohort study published since the above recommendations found that breastfeeding at the time of IUD insertion increased the risk of uterine perforation.[9] Another recent randomized trial found that the expulsion rate of the levonorgestrel IUD was unacceptably high in breastfeeding women.[10]<br><br>  After use of levonorgestrel as a postcoital contraceptive, nursing can resume 3 to 4 hours after the dose (or after each dose if the two-dose method is used). Postcoital levonorgestrel appears to have no long-term adverse effects on breastfeeding.[11][12][13]"

With the 30 mcg dose, the drug was undetectable in all of the women in prenursing milk (  < 0.05 mcg/L) or postnursing milk (  < 0.1 mcg/L) at 3 to 23 hours after the dose. With the 150 mcg dose, the highest levels in milk were found 3 hours after the dose with foremilk and hindmilk levels of 0.34 and 0.54 mcg/L, respectively; levels decreased to 0.11 and 0.17 mcg/L, respectively, at 23 hours after the dose. With the 250 mcg dose, the highest levels in milk were found 3 hours after the dose with foremilk and hindmilk levels of 0.51 and 1.05 mcg/L, respectively; levels decreased to 0.22 and 0.38 mcg/L, respectively, at 23 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that fully breastfed infants would receive 0.4 to 0.5 mcg daily in breastmilk, or about 0.1% of the total (not weight-adjusted) maternal dose.[14] Two women with well-established lactation (exact time postpartum not stated) were given an oral contraceptive containing 150 mcg of levonorgestrel daily. Each had breastmilk levels measured on 2 occasions 10 to 12 hours after a dose between days 6 and 20 of use. The average of their levonorgestrel milk levels was 0.18 mcg/L (range 0.135 to 0.223 mcg/L).[15] Milk levonorgestrel levels were measured in 4 women after daily ingestion of oral levonorgestrel 50 or 150 mcg started after 3 months postpartum. Peak milk levonorgestrel levels occurred between 1 and 3 hours and were in the ranges of 0.06 to 0.2 mcg/L after the 50 mcg dose and 0.35 to 0.45 mcg/L after the 150 mcg dose. After the 50 mcg dose, milk levels dropped to undetectable (  < 0.05 mcg/L) by 4 hours after the dose. After the 150 mcg dose, milk levels dropped to about 0.35 mcg/L at 4 hours after the dose and remained there for the next 2 hours.[16]At 6 to 20 weeks postpartum, 10 women received single tablets containing 30 mcg of levonorgestrel and another 15 women received a single tablet of a combination oral contraceptive containing 250 mcg of levonorgestrel. At 2 to 2.5 hours after the dose, a foremilk sample was taken. The mothers breastfed their infants and then a hindmilk sample was taken. The 2 samples were pooled for assay. After the 30 mcg dose, milk levels averaged 0.05 mcg/L (range 0.03 to 0.076 mcg/L); after the 250 mcg dose, milk levels averaged 0.64 mcg/L (range 0.3 to 1.3 mcg/L).[17] Twelve breastfeeding women averaging 11.1 weeks postpartum (range 6 and 12 weeks) received a single dose of 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel orally. Blood and milk samples were obtained over the next 72 hours. Peak milk levels of levonorgestrel occurred 3.9 hours after the dose; milk levels fell with a mean half-life in milk of 26 hours. The mean concentration in milk was 1.7 mcg/L during the first day, 0.4 mcg/L the second day and 0.2 mcg/L on the third day after the dose. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive 1.6 mcg of levonorgestrel in the first 24 hours, 0.3 mcg in the second 24 hours, and 0.2 mcg in the third 24 hours after the dose.[18] Maternal Levels: Inplant. One hundred women who received Norplant implants at an average of day 55 postpartum were compared to 100 women receiving a postpartum nonhormonal IUD. Milk levonorgestrel levels were measured at various times after insertion. During days 1 to 4 postinsertion, average milk levels were 0.079 mcg/L (n = 5); during days 9 to 14, average levels were 0.128 mcg/L (n = 22); during days 16 to 22, average levels were 0.163 mcg/L (n = 3); and during days 34 to 40, average levels were 0.116 mcg/L (n = 21). The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive a levonorgestrel dosage of 15 to 18 ng/kg daily in breastmilk during this time period.[19] A study compared women who received Norplant-2 (n = 14), an IUD that released 20 mcg levonorgestrel daily (n = 14) or oral tablets containing 30 mcg of levonorgestrel (n = 10) at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum. Pooled fore- and hindmilk samples were measured several times on the first day of drug use and periodically thereafter until day 28. Norplant-2 users had milk levels that reached an average of 0.067 mcg/L by day 2 and maintained those levels throughout the 28 days. IUD users had milk levels that reached an average of 0.046 mcg/L by day 2 and maintained those levels throughout the 28 days. Oral tablet users had 2-hour peak milk levels that averaged 0.05 mcg/L throughout the 28 days.[20] Maternal Levels: IUD. Ten women had IUDs that released either 10 mg or 30 mcg of levonorgestrel daily placed at 6 weeks postpartum. Milk was analyzed for levonorgestrel at various times over a 12-month period. All milk levels were less than 0.1 mcg/L, regardless of the dose that the mother was receiving.[21] Infant Levels: Oral. Two 8-week old infants whose mothers were taking a combination oral contraceptive containing 250 mcg of levonorgestrel had plasma levels measured 5 hours after the maternal dose and 2 hours after nursing (i.e., nursed at the time of peak milk level). Plasma levels were 0.058 and 0.115 mcg/L in the 2 infants. A third infant whose mother was taking 30 mcg daily had undetectable (  < 0.005 mcg/L) in its plasma. The authors concluded that these results indicate that the infants are able to metabolize levonorgestrel and that no accumulation occurs in infant plasma.[14] At 6 to 20 weeks postpartum, 10 women received single tablets containing 30 mcg of levonorgestrel and another 15 women received a single tablet of a combination oral contraceptive containing 250 mcg of levonorgestrel. At 2 to 2.5 hours after the dose, the mothers breastfed their infants; infant serum samples were taken 1.5 to 2 hours later at about 4 hours after the maternal dose. Infant serum levels after the 30 and 250 mcg doses averaged 0.019 and 0.078 mcg/L, respectively. These levels were 2% and 1%, respectively, of peak maternal serum levels drawn at 2 to 2.5 hours after the dose.[17] Thirty mothers received 30 mcg oral levonorgestrel tablets daily for 5 weeks. Ten began at 4 weeks postpartum, 10 began at 12 weeks postpartum and 10 began at 24 weeks postpartum. Because of assay and serum sample size limitations, serum samples were obtained from some of the breastfed infants during the first and fifth weeks of maternal therapy as representative of the entire group. Based on infant serum levels, the authors concluded that absorption of the drug was not great until 12 weeks postpartum and metabolism was not well developed until 24 weeks postpartum.[22] The unusual and incomplete blood sampling scheme casts some doubt on the results of this study. Infant Levels: Implant. Forty-two women received Norplant implants between days 30 and 40 postpartum. The women breastfed for 1 year and donated 1 blood sample from herself and her infant once during the year. Infant serum levels averaged 1.5 mcg/L during the first month postpartum (n = 10); 3.95 mcg/L during the third month postpartum (n = 3); 4.2 mcg/L during the sixth month postpartum (n = 12); 2.5 mcg/L during the ninth month postpartum (n = 8); and, 3.6 mcg/L during the twelfth month postpartum (n = 11). Overall, the infants' serum levonorgestrel levels averaged 9.9% (range 4.9 to 12.6%) of simultaneous maternal serum levels.[23] A study compared women who received levonorgestrel as a contraceptive via Norplant-2 (n = 14), an IUD that released 20 mcg daily (n = 14) or oral tablets containing 30 mcg of levonorgestrel (n = 10) at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum. The serum levels of infants averaged 0.046 mcg/L and 0.03 mcg/L in infants whose mothers used Norplant-2 and the IUD, respectively. Infants whose mothers used oral levonorgestrel had peak serum levels (i.e., 2-hour postnursing and 4 hours after maternal ingestion) serum levels of 0.02 mcg/L. Infant serum levels averaged 2.9 to 4.6%, 6.7% and 2.2% of maternal serum levels for Norplant-2, the IUD and oral tablets, respectively.[20]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Numerous studies have found no systematic differences in growth, development or illness rates between the infants of mothers who received Norplant as a contraceptive and those of other mothers receiving either no contraception or nonhormonal contraception.[19][24][25][26][27][28] One study found serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels to be lower in the infants exposed to levonorgestrel than in control infants.[29] Oral and Implant. A nonrandomized trial compared 250 breastfed infants whose mothers received 30 mcg daily of oral levonorgestrel initiated 7 days postpartum to 250 infants whose mothers received nonhormonal contraception. No differences in height and weight gain were seen during the 9-month study period between the 2 groups.[30] Ten women received Norplant-2 beginning at 4 weeks postpartum. Mothers collected 4-hour urine samples daily from weeks 4 to 11 postpartum from their infants. Urine samples were analyzed for follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone. No difference was found in these levels when compared to those of infants whose mothers were taking either no contraception or an oral progestin-only contraceptive containing 30 mcg of levonorgestrel.[31] Multicenter, nonrandomized studies followed infants whose mothers received levonorgestrel contraception during breastfeeding, either as oral tablets of 37.5 mcg daily (n = 246) or as Norplant (n = 453). No adverse effects on infant growth through the first year were found in comparison to standard measurements.[32][33] In a continuation study, infants from these studies who were exposed to levonorgestrel via Norplant (total n = 220) were followed up to 6 years of age. Infants were fully breastfed for an average of 7.8 months and were breastfed at least once daily for an average of 16.5 months. No differences in growth, diseases, surgery or hospitalizations were found from years 2 though 6 between infants whose mothers used levonorgestrel implants or Copper T IUD. An increase in skin conditions occurred in the levonorgestrel group and an increase in urogenital conditions occurred in the Copper T group.[28]In a cohort study of 71 women who took levonorgestrel as a postcoital contraceptive found no obvious decrease in milk supply after the drug was used according to maternal reports 75% of mothers re-initiated breastfeeding before 8 hours after the dose. None noticed any adverse effect in their infants.[11] IUD IUDs that released levonorgestrel were inserted 6 weeks after delivery. IUDs released 10 mcg per day (n = 30) or 30 mcg per day (n = 40); copper-releasing IUDs (n = 40) were used as controls. No differences were seen in infant height, weight, development, respiratory infections or blood chemistries up to 12 months of age between the levonorgestrel and copper IUD groups.[34] Three hundred twenty lactating women were randomized to either an IUD containing levonorgestrel (Mirena; n =163) or the copper-containing IUD Cu T380A group (n =157). Follow-up of infants for 1 year found no differences in growth and development or in duration of breastfeeding.[35]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Numerous studies of varying size and quality have found that the use of levonorgestrel implants (Norplant or Norplant-2) as a contraceptive beginning at 7 days postpartum or later either has no clinically important negative effect on the quality of breastmilk and results in either no effect or an increase in the milk supply and duration of lactation.[25][27][30][36][37][38][39] In a nonrandomized study, 100 women who received Norplant implants at an average of day 55 postpartum were compared to 100 women receiving a postpartum IUD. No differences were found between the control and Norplant groups in the number of women nursing at days 10 and 20 and months 1 to 12 postinsertion except a slight decrease in the number of mothers using Norplant who were exclusively breastfeeding at 12 months. No difference since the time of weaning was noted between the groups.[19] IUDs releasing levonorgestrel were inserted 6 weeks after delivery. IUDs released 10 mcg per day (n = 30) or 30 mcg per day (n = 40); copper-releasing IUDs (n = 40) were used as controls. The rate of breastfeeding discontinuation was higher with the levonorgestrel groups than in the copper IUD group at 75 days, but not at other times.[34] In a nonrandomized, nonblinded study comparing women who were breastfeeding at discharge, 102 postpartum women received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (dosage not stated) in the early postpartum period (average 51.9 hours postpartum; range 6.25 to 132 hours), 181 received another progestin-only contraceptive and 138 used nonhormonal contraception. No differences in breastfeeding rates were seen at 2 and 6 weeks, but women receiving any hormonal contraceptive were breastfeeding at a lower rate (72.1% vs 77.6%) at 4 weeks postpartum. The authors concluded that progestin-only contraception initiated in the early postpartum period had no adverse effects on breastfeeding rates.[40] In a small prospective study, forty-six women were randomized to have an IUD containing levonorgestrel (Mirena) inserted either within 10 minutes after placental delivery (n = 15), between 10 minutes and 48 hours after placental delivery (n = 15), or after 6 weeks postpartum (n = 16). At 6 months postpartum, no statistical difference in the rates of continued breastfeeding (extent not stated) was found among the groups.[7] Women who gave birth were offered contraception with a levonorgestrel-containing IUD and randomized to have the IUD placed immediately following delivery (n = 46) or at 6 to 8 weeks postpartum (n = 50). Women randomized to later IUD insertion were more likely to be nursing at 6 months postpartum (24% vs 6%) and tended to have a longer median duration of exclusive breastfeeding.[8] Among a cohort study of 71 women who took levonorgestrel as a postcoital contraceptive during nursing, none reported any obvious decrease in milk supply after the drug was used.[11] A study of 1158 postpartum randomized women using the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) for birth control randomized to be given levonorgestrel as a postcoital contraceptive or given nothing. No difference in the duration of breastfeeding was found between women who used the levonorgestrel and those who did not.[12] A prospective, nonrandomized trial compared 4 contraceptives in 10 women each to assess their effect on milk production. One of the following were begun on day 42 postpartum as chosen by the mother: combined ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg plus levonorgestrel 150 mcg (Microvlar), etonogestrel implant (Implanon), levonorgestrel intrauterine system (Myrena), or a copper IUD (Optima). Milk intake was measured using deuterium oxide given to the mother and measured in the infants' saliva as well as numbers of wet diapers per day. Infants were also weighed and measured to assess growth. No differences in milk intake or infant growth were observed between the methods from days 42 through 63.[41]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Although nonhormonal methods are preferred during breastfeeding, progestin-only contraceptives such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) are considered the hormonal contraceptives of choice during all stages of lactation. Fair quality evidence indicates that DMPA does not adversely affect the composition of milk, the growth and development of the infant, or the milk supply.[1][2][3] Some evidence indicates that progestin-only contraceptives may offer protection against bone mineral density loss during lactation, or at least do not exacerbate it.[4][5][6]<br><br>  The timing of initiation of DMPA is controversial.[7] The product labeling states that it should be started no sooner than 6 weeks postpartum, based on data submitted for product approval. Studies of fair quality seem to indicate that concerns about immediate adverse effects on the infants is unfounded; however, starting too soon theoretically could affect the newborn infant adversely because of slower metabolism of the drug than older infants. Of concern is that no data exist on the effects of progesterone on brain and liver development at this age. Administration sooner than 6 weeks postpartum could interfere with the exclusivity or duration of lactation. A systematic review of  studies using early postpartum initiation of DMPA concluded that all of the studies were of low quality and inadequate to disprove the concern about DMPA's effects on milk production if given sooner than 6 weeks after delivery.[8] A subsequent study raised the possibility of a slight reduction in breastfeeding duration in women given DMPA before hospital discharge.[9]<br><br>  Expert opinion in the United States holds that the risks of progestin-only contraceptive products usually are acceptable for nursing mothers at any time postpartum.[10] The World Health Association recommends introduction of progestin-only contraceptives at 6 weeks postpartum.[11]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Seven women were given a single intramuscular dose of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 150 mg 1 week after delivery. Peak milk levels occurred at varying times between days 8 to 28 after the injection, with most between 1 and 2 weeks. Peak levels ranged from 1.3 to 2.3 mcg/L. In 3 women, levels were measured 50 to 87 days after the dose and were still detectable in milk in the range of 0.54 to 0.98 mcg/L.[12] Ten women received a single dose of  depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 150 mg at 6 to 7 weeks postpartum. Breastmilk levels were measured weekly for 12 weeks. Average milk levels were highest at 1 week after injection at about 7.5 mcg/L and gradually fell to about 0.5 mcg/L at 12 weeks after the injection. The authors estimated that a breastfed infant would receive 1 to 13 mcg/day at 1 week after injection, 0.2 to 1.5 mcg/day 8 weeks after injection and up to 1 mcg/day at 12 weeks after injection.[13] Infant Levels. Thirteen male infants whose mothers received 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly at weeks 6 and 18 postpartum were breastfed. Complete 4-hour urine specimens were collected on 20 occasions during maternal treatment, including on the days after the injection known to have high maternal serum levels. No medroxyprogesterone or metabolites were detected by GC-MS assay (lower limit not specified) in the urine of the infants.[14]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In a nonrandomized study, 228 women chose depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection every 3 months as a postpartum contraceptive starting in months 2 to 4 postpartum. Eighty-eight percent of the women breastfed their infants for at least 6 months. Infants were examined during the study and again at age 4.5 years. No adverse effects on infant growth and development were noted in the exposed infants.[15] One follow-up study of 1215 children whose mothers received depot medroxyprogesterone during nursing reported a delayed appearance of pubic hair (reported by mothers) in pubescent girls, but not boys. No other effects on growth were observed after correction for socioeconomic status.[16] A multicenter, nonrandomized study followed 541 infants whose mothers received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection 150 mg every 3 months for contraception during breastfeeding. No adverse effects on infant growth through the first year were found in comparison to standard measurements.[17][18] Thirteen male breastfed infants whose mothers received 150 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly at weeks 6 and 18 postpartum were studied. No differences were found in serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, unconjugated testosterone, or cortisol compared to those of a group of 9 control infants.[14] In a nonrandomized study comparing 190 infants of women using depot medroxyprogesterone to those using a nonhormonal contraceptive or no contraception starting at about day 57 postpartum, no difference in infant growth rates were seen from birth to 6 months of age, regardless of whether the infant was fully or partially breastfed.[19] In a retrospective cohort study of 270 infants whose mothers were given DMPA postpartum, no effect of DMPA on weight when adjusted for cofounders and no differences between groups in psychomotor development, milestones, health problems, infant height or physical examinations.[20] A non-blinded, randomized study of exclusively breastfeeding women compared those who received an etonogestrel implant 24-48 hours after delivery (n = 20) to those who received a 150 mg depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection at 6 weeks postpartum (n = 20). No difference in infant weight gain was noted between the two groups.[21] One-hundred-fifty mothers were given 150 mg of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly after breastfeeding was established postpartum, but before discharge at 2 to 10 days; a second dose was given at 3 months postpartum. The growth (height and weight) and illnesses of their infants was compared to those of a control group in a case-control study. No difference between the groups was seen at 1.5, 3 and 6 months postpartum. The day postpartum when the injection was given had no effect on the outcome.[22]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Galactorrhea has been reported in nonpregnant, nonlactating women using depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). In one case series, 3.6% of 360 adolescents who used depot medroxyprogesterone acetate as a contraceptive for at least 6 months developed galactorrhea with normal prolactin levels.[23] Numerous studies found that the use of intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate as a contraceptive beginning at 7 days postpartum or later either has no negative effect or causes increases in the milk supply, duration of lactation or quality of breastmilk.[15][17][19][20][24][25][26][27][28][29][30] However, most of these were so seriously flawed that no valid conclusion can be drawn on the effect of early initiation on breastfeeding duration.[8] Twenty-five women who were 6 weeks postpartum were given a single injection of 150 mg of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Serum prolactin levels were compared to those of 25 women who used an IUD. All women breastfed their infants to about the same extent. Basal serum prolactin levels were similar between the groups at the beginning of the study. These levels slowly decreased in the IUD group, but increased in the medroxyprogesterone group. The differences were statistically significant at 6 weeks after the start of the study. Basal prolactin increases in the medroxyprogesterone were 14% over baseline and 59% over the IUD group at 6 weeks.[31] Women (n = 80) were assigned randomly to receive intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) 250 mg 1 to 2 days postpartum. Other women in the study (n = 616) were started on DMPA at 30 days postpartum. The median duration of lactation in both groups was longer in these women than the lactation duration following previous births.[32] A nonrandomized, nonblinded study compared women who received either nonhormonal contraception (n = 56) or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (n =  47) 150 mg intramuscularly upon discharge from the hospital. No statistical differences were found in the breastfeeding rates or percentage of women exclusively breastfeeding between the 2 groups of women at 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16 weeks postpartum.[33] In a nonrandomized, nonblinded study comparing women who were breastfeeding at discharge, 102 postpartum women received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (dosage not stated) in the early postpartum period (average 51.9 hours postpartum; range 6.25 to 132 hours), 181 received another progestin-only contraceptive and 138 used nonhormonal contraception. No differences in breastfeeding rates were seen at 2 and 6 weeks, but women receiving any hormonal contraceptive were breastfeeding at a lower rate (72.1% vs 77.6%) at 4 weeks postpartum. The authors concluded that progestin-only contraception initiated in the early postpartum period had no adverse effects on breastfeeding rates.[34]A survey of 183 women who delivered in one hospital compared those who received DMPA after delivery and prior to discharge (n = 68) to those who did not receive the treatment (n = 115). There was a slight, but not statistically significant reduction in the duration of lactation among the mothers who received the early DMPA.[9] One-hundred-fifty mothers were given 150 mg of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscularly after breastfeeding was established postpartum, but before discharge at 2 to 10 days; a second dose was given at 3 months postpartum. In a case-control study these mothers were compared to a control group of women receiving no postpartum contraception. No difference was found between the groups in the number of nursings per day over the 6-month follow-up period, nor was there a difference in patient satisfaction in multiparous mothers compared to previous breastfeeding experience(s).[22]"

Peak milk norethindrone levels in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 mcg/L occurred between 1 and 3 hours after the dose and dropped slowly over the 6-hour study interval to about 0.15 to 0.4 mcg/L.[10] At 6 to 20 weeks postpartum, 15 women received a single tablet of a combination oral contraceptive containing a dose of 3 mg of norethindrone. At 2 to 2.5 hours after the dose, a foremilk sample was taken. The mothers breastfed their infants and then a hindmilk sample was taken. The two samples were pooled for assay.

A meta-analysis of published studies found evidence that bromocriptine is more effective than placebo for lactation suppression during the first week postpartum, but evidence is insufficient to comment on the acceptability of such therapy.[7] Rebound lactation after cessation of therapy may be controlled with a dose of 2.5 mg once daily for 1 additional week.[8] Bromocriptine also prevents puerperal fever caused by either breast engorgement or infection among women who do not nurse their newborn infants.[9] The indication of postpartum breast engorgement was removed in the United States in 1994 because of serious maternal toxicity, including stroke (some fatal), convulsions, myocardial infarction (some fatal) and severe hypertension.[10] One study found that seizure risk was decreased in the early puerperium, but increased slightly later.[11] Cerebral angiopathy, stroke and seizures continue to be reported from countries where bromocriptine is still used to suppress lactation.[12][13][14] An early double-blind study in 60 women who were less than 24 hours postpartum found bromocriptine to be as effective as diethylstilbestrol in suppressing postpartum lactation. Bromocriptine was given in a dosage of 5 mg twice daily for 6 days followed by 5 mg three times daily for 3 days. Diethylstilbestrol dosage was 20 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 10 mg twice daily for 3 days, then 10 mg daily for 3 days.[15] Hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea have been reported occasionally after withdrawal of long-term therapy with high doses (5 to 10 mg 3 times daily) of bromocriptine for treatment of parkinsonism.[16] In women given bromocriptine immediately postpartum, the composition of milk is altered from the milk of normal lactation. Most protein constituents (e.g., total protein, albumin, alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, IgA and IgG) appear in higher concentrations than normal, similar to those of colostrum. Lactose levels are suppressed.[17] A study in 14 women who were overproducing milk on day 3 postpartum found that oral bromocriptine 2.5 mg once daily for 3 days reduced serum prolactin to subnormal levels, but rebounded to control levels by 36 hours after the last dose. In contrast, the milk yield decreased by 25% from baseline and the decrease persisted for at least 12 days afer the last dose.[4] A woman who was treated with bromocriptine 5 mg daily for the amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome during pregnancy continued taking the drug in the same dosage after delivery and successfully breastfed her infant.[18] In a case series of 40 women with pituitary adenoma and hyperprolactinemia, 30 of the women took bromocriptine 2.5 or 5 mg daily during pregnancy.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Short-term or occasional use of dichloralphenazone during breastfeeding is unlikely to adversely affect the breastfed infant, especially if the infant is older than 2 months. Because the active metabolite, trichloroethanol, has a long half-life, long-term use of repeated doses during breastfeeding could result in infant sedation, especially while nursing a neonate or preterm infant. The low doses of dichloralphenazone found in combination migraine products (e.g., Midrin) are less likely to cause drowsiness in the infant unless doses are repeated several times daily. The antipyrine component of dichloralphenazone is considered unlikely to harm the infant.[1][2] Monitor the infant for excessive drowsiness during use."
    drug_levels: "Dichloralphenazone is a chemical combination of chloral hydrate (64%) and antipyrine (36%). Maternal Levels: After 1.3 grams of dichloralphenazone (equivalent to about 830 mg of chloral hydrate) daily in a woman who was 5 month postpartum, milk trichloroethanol levels were found to range from 1.3 to 3.2 mg/L.[3] Antipyrine was given to 7 lactating women were 2 to 19 months postpartum. Each woman drank a single oral dose of 18 mg/kg of antipyrine in solution. Peak milk levels usually occurred 10 minutes after ingestion and ranged from about 10 to 30 mg/L. The antipyrine half-life in milk averaged 11.6 hours (range 5.7 to 21.7 hours). The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would ingest 6.4 mg of antipyrine after this maternal dose or 0.59% of the maternal dose (not weight-adjusted). Two of the women who were studied before and after pregnancy indicated that antipyrine clearance might be increased by about two-fold during lactation.[1] The time course of antipyrine appearance in milk is probably slower than above from dichloralphenazone in a tablet formulation.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Divalproex results in valproic acid in the maternal bloodstream. Because of the low levels of valproic acid in breastmilk and infant serum, no unquestionable adverse reactions to valproic acid during breastfeeding have been reported. Theoretically, breastfed infants are at risk for valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity, so infants should be monitored for jaundice and other signs of liver damage during maternal therapy. A questionable case of thrombocytopenia has been reported, so monitor the infant for unusual bruising or bleeding. One author recommends monitoring infant serum valproate levels, platelets and liver enzymes during therapy.[1] Combination therapy with sedating anticonvulsants or psychotropics may result in infant sedation or withdrawal reactions."
    drug_levels: "In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Divalprox is the chemical combination of 2 valproic acid molecules that results in valproic acid in the bloodstream. Although divalproex has not been studied during breastfeeding, its properties are expected to be identical to those of valproic acid with respect to breastfeeding. Maternal Levels: An epileptic mother was taking valproic acid 2.4 g daily and primidone 250 mg 3 times daily during pregnancy and postpartum. During the second week postpartum, a breastmilk valproic acid level was 7 mg/L, which was 7% of her serum level.[2] An epileptic mother was taking valproic acid 1.6 g daily in divided doses. The breastmilk level at 5 days postpartum was 7.2 mg/L; by 29 days postpartum, it had fallen to 3 mg/L.[3] A woman was taking valproic acid 250 mg twice daily during pregnancy and postpartum. At 62 hours postpartum (16 hours after her last dose) she had a milk level of 180 mcg/L. At 130 hours postpartum (3 hours after her last dose) she had a milk level of 460 mcg/L.[4] A woman taking valproic acid 250 mg twice daily had milk valproate levels of 2 mg/L 30 minutes after taking a dose. The milk level fell to 0.43 mg/L 1 hour later and to undetectable levels (  < 0.4 mg/L) an hour after that.[5] The valproic acid level in the breastmilk of mothers 5 mothers taking valproic acid ranged between 0.4 to 3.9 mg/L. The dosages they were receiving was not stated, but milk levels ranged between 1.3 and 7.1% of the maternal plasma level.[6] This case series was extended to 16 women taking an average of 22.1 mg/kg daily of valproic acid. They had average milk valproate levels of 1.8 mg/L.[7] In 6 women taking valproic acid in dosages ranging from 9.6 to 31 mg/kg daily, milk valproate levels ranged from 0.034 to 5.4 mg/L and levels of the metabolite 3-keto-valproate ranged from 0.04 to 0.48 mg/L.[8] Extension of the study to 13 patients did not markedly alter the results.[9] Four women taking valproic acid (1 took 1.2 g daily and 3 took 1.5 g daily)had breastmilk valproate levels measured. Specific milk concentrations are not given, but milk levels were 50 to 10% of maternal serum levels, consistent with other studies. The authors estimated that a breastfed infant would receive only 6 mg in a liter of milk.[10] Four mothers taking valproic acid (3 took 1.2 g daily and 1 took 1.8 g daily) during pregnancy and postpartum had breastmilk levels measured during the first week postpartum. The average breastmilk levels were 1.8 mg/L (range 1 to 3.8 mg/L).[11] One woman taking valproic acid 1 g daily had milk levels of 3, 2.3 and 1.4 mg/L on postpartum days 6, 7, and 17, respectively. Another woman was taking valproic acid 1.4 g plus carbamazepine 600 mg and diazepam 2 mg daily. Milk valproate levels were 2, 1.4, 3.5, 2.3 and 2.8 mg/L on postpartum days 1, 3, 15, 29, and 43, respectively.[12] Infant Levels: The breastfed infant of an epileptic mother who was taking valproic acid 1.6 g daily in divided doses had serum valproic acid level of about 7.5 mg/L on day 5 of life that fell to undetectable levels by day 29.[3] A 2-month-old breastfed infant was nursed by a mother taking valproic acid 250 mg twice daily. Infant serum levels were undetectable (  < 0.4 mg/L) before nursing and reached a peak of 2 mg/L 30 minutes after nursing which was 2 hours after the mother's dose. The serum level fell to 1 mg/L 1.5 hours later.[5] The infant of a mother who was taking valproic acid monotherapy 600 mg twice daily had a serum valproic acid level of 6.6 mg/L.[13] Two infants were studied whose mothers were taking valproic acid monotherapy for bipolar disorder. A 1-month-old infant had a serum valproate level of 4 mg/L during maternal therapy with 750 mg daily in divided doses. Another fully breastfed 3-month-old whose mother was taking 250 mg of valproic acid twice daily had a serum level of 1 mg/L.[14] Two breastfed infants whose mothers were taking valproic acid 500 mg daily for bipolar disorder had undetectable (  < 3.5 and   < 5 mcg/L) serum valproate levels. Both mothers were also taking clonazepam; one was also taking trifluoperazine and the other was taking fluoxetine.[15] Four exclusively breastfed infants whose mothers began taking valproic acid monotherapy postpartum in dosages of 750 or 1000 mg daily had average serum levels of 1 mg/L which averaged 1.8% of their mothers' serum levels. Another infant that was 80% breastfed during maternal treatment with 1 g daily had a serum level of 0.7 mg/L or 1% of the maternal serum level. A sixth infant that was 50% breastfed during maternal treatment with 1 g daily had a serum level of 0.7 mg/L or 1.2% of the maternal serum level. All infant serum levels were taken between 4 and 19 weeks of age.[16]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "An epileptic mother was taking valproic acid 2.4 g daily and primidone 250 mg 3 times daily during pregnancy and postpartum. During the second week postpartum, her breastfed infant was sedated. Breastfeeding was stopped and the drowsiness cleared.[2] The sedation was possibly caused by primidone in breastmilk although valproic acid might have contributed by increasing primidone levels. Petechiae, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and mild hematuria occurred in a 2.5-month-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking valproic acid 600 mg twice daily. The petechiae resolved 8 days after discontinuing breastfeeding. The authors believed the adverse effect to be caused by valproic acid in breastmilk.[13] However, other authors believe that these symptoms were more likely caused by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura following a viral infection.[16] Two breastfed infants aged 1 and 3 months whose mothers were taking valproic acid monotherapy 750 and 500 mg daily developed normally and had no abnormal laboratory values. Their plasma levels were 6% and 1.5% or their mother's serum levels, respectively.[14] Six breastfed infants whose mothers were taking valproic acid 750 or 1000 mg daily had no adverse reactions to valproic acid in breastmilk.[16] An exclusively breastfed infants whose mother was taking valproate 1.8 g, topiramate 300 mg, and levetiracetam 2 g, daily during pregnancy and lactation appeared healthy to the investigators throughout the 6- to 8-week study period.[17] In a long-term study on infants exposed to anticonvulsants during breastfeeding, no difference in average intelligence quotient at 3 years of age was found between infants who were breastfed (n = 11) and those not breastfed (n = 24) when their mothers were taking valproate.[18]"

Maternal Levels: One woman with ulcerative colitis (time postpartum not stated) was taking delayed-release tablets of mesalamine (Claversal) 500 mg orally 3 times daily. A single milk sample taken 5.25 hours after a dose contained 0.11 mg/L of mesalamine and 12.4 mg/L of N-acetyl-5-ASA.[4] A woman with inactive ulcerative colitis was taking mesalamine (product not specified) 1 gram orally 3 times daily. A milk sample taken 1 week postpartum at 5 hours after a dose contained mesalamine 0.1 mg/L and N-acetyl-5-ASA 18.1 mg/L. Another milk sample taken 4 days later at 5 hours after a dose contained mesalamine 0.1 mg/L and N-acetyl-5-ASA 12.3 mg/L. The authors also report another mother taking 1 g of mesalamine daily (product not specified) who had a milk level of mesalamine that was undetectable and  N-acetyl-5-ASA level of 2.2 mg/L (time of sampling and assay method not reported). The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant whose mother was taking 1.5 grams of mesalamine daily would receive 0.015 mg/kg of mesalamine and 2.3 mg/kg of N-acetyl-5-ASA daily.[5] Twelve women taking mesalamine in various oral dosage forms and one taking olsalazine capsules collected 1 to 8 breastmilk samples during one day 2 to 4 weeks postpartum. Mesalamine was undetectable (  <  20 mcg/L) in most women, but detected in the milk of 3 women; one was taking Pentasa tablets 1 gram 3 times daily and one was taking Pentasa suppositories 1 gram at night and one was taking oral Asacol 400 mg twice daily plus Mesalal tablets 500 mg at night. Mesalamine milk levels ranged from 20 to 81 mcg/L. N-acetyl-5-ASA was detected in all milk samples, but there was no clear relationship between the dosages, times of the doses and the peak time in breastmilk. The individual average N-acetyl-5-ASA milk levels by product and dosage were Asacol tablets 800 mg daily, 0.24 mg/L (1 patient); Asacol tablets 800 mg daily plus Mesalal tablets 500 mg at night, 2.6 mg/L (1 patient); Mesalal tablets 500 mg daily, 0.75 mg/L (1 patient); Pentasa tablets 500 mg daily, 0.97 mg/L (1 patient); Pentasa tablets 1.5 grams daily, 2.8 to 6.5 mg/L (5 patients); Pentasa tablets 2 grams daily, 10.5 mg/L (1 patient); Pentasa tablets 3 grams daily, 10.2 mg/L (1 patient); Pentasa suppositories 1 gram daily, 1.9 mg/L (1 patient). Using the highest individual measured of 16.2 mg/L, the authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive about 15 mg of N-acetyl-5-ASA daily, which is 1% ot the usual daily dosage (not weight-adjusted) of mesalamine.[6] Four women with inflammatory bowel disease who were breastfeeding during mesalamine use had breastmilk samples taken. Specific dosages and mesalamine products were not reported nor were sampling times with respect to the doses. Mesalamine milk levels ranged from 4 to 40 mcg/L and N-acetyl-5-ASA milk levels ranged from 5 to 14.9 mg/L. The authors calculated a daily dosage of mesalamine of 0.6 to 6 mcg/kg daily in an exclusively breastfed infant. However, the N-acetyl-5-ASA dosage would be about 1000 times greater. The authors speculated that mesalamine might be metabolized in the breast to N-acetyl-5-ASA in the breast tissue, but provided no direct evidence of this happening.[7] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

The drug was stopped and reintroduced 4 times and each time the infant's diarrhea began 8 to 12 hours after the drug was started and ceased 8 to 12 hours after the drug was stopped. The infant's diarrhea was probably caused by mesalamine or it metabolite in breastmilk.[8] A 4-month-old breastfed infant developed thrombosis of the superior saggital sinus following severe thrombocytosis. The infant's mother was receiving oral mesalamine in dosages averaging 1 to 1.5 grams daily throughout pregnancy and lactation. Breastfeeding had been stopped abruptly 1 week prior to the thrombotic event. The authors ruled out other causes of thrombosis and hypothesized that the abrupt discontinuation of long-term mesalamine exposure caused the thrombocytosis and  thrombosis in the infant. They rated the reaction as possibly caused by the drug.[9] In a  prospective telephone follow-up study, 8 nursing mothers reported taking mesalamine (dosage and route unspecified). One mother reported diarrhea in her infant. No other adverse reactions were reported in the infants by their mothers.[10] A small controlled study reported only in abstract form found no higher rate of diarrhea in the breastfed infants of mothers taking mesalamine or sulfasalazine than in control infants.[11]"

Milk levels averaged 3.4 mg/L at 4 hours, 2.8 mg/L at 8 hours and 1.3 mg/L at 12 hours (5 women) after the dose.[7] Seventeen mothers in a randomized study received oral metronidazole 200 mg 3 times daily for 7 days postpartum. Milk metronidazole levels taken at unstated times on day 6 averaged 4.7 mg/L (range 1.1 to 15.2 mg/L).[8] Three women were give a single 2 gram oral dose of metronidazole for trichomoniasis. Average milk levels were 45.8 mg/L at 2 hours after the dose, 27.9 mg/L at 8 hours after the dose, 19.1 mg/L at 12 hours after the dose, 12.6 mg/L at 18 hours (2 women) and 3.5 mg/L at 36 hours after the dose (2 women). The authors estimated that the infants would receive a total of 25.3 mg over the 48 hours following this dose.[9] Fifteen women received 200 mg (n = 11) or 400 mg (n = 4) of metronidazole orally 3 times a day for postpartum endometritis 0 to 22 days postpartum. Single milk samples taken after 1 to 9 days of therapy and from 30 minutes to 4 hours after a 200 mg dose contained 1.6 to 12.2 mg/L of metronidazole and 1.1 to 3.8 mg/L of hydroxymetronidazole. Milk samples taken 2 to 3 hours after a 400 mg dose contained 11.6 to 18 mg/L of metronidazole and 2.4 to 6.3 mg/L of hydroxymetronidazole.[10] Twelve women taking oral metronidazole 400 mg 3 times daily at an average of 4.3 days postpartum had milk samples taken on days 3 and 4 postpartum. Milk levels of metronidazole averaged 15.5 mg/L at 2 hours after the dose, 12.9 mg/L at 4 hours after the dose, 10.6 mg/L at 6 hours after the dose, and 9.1 mg/L at 8 hours after the dose. Milk levels of hydroxymetronidazole averaged 5.5 mg/L at 2 hours after the dose, 5.7 mg/L at 4 hours after the dose, 5.6 mg/L at 6 hours after the dose, and 5.5 mg/L at 8 hours after the dose. The authors estimated that a breastfed neonate ingesting 500 mL of milk daily with this maternal dosage would receive less than 10% of the recommended newborn dosage of metronidazole.[11] Fifteen women who were 1 month postpartum were given a single intravenous dose of metronidazole 500 mg. The average breastmilk levels at 2 hours after the dose was 7.55 mg/L.[12] Infant Levels: Ten 5-day-old infants were breastfed every 4 hours after a single 200 mg oral dose of metronidazole was given to their mothers. Two infants had metronidazole serum levels of 0.28 and 0.4 mg/L and 3 had unmeasurable (  < 0.05 mg/L) levels 8 hours after the dose. Another 2 infants had metronidazole serum levels of 0.2 mg/L and another 3 had unmeasurable (  < 0.05 mg/L) levels 12 hours after the dose.[7] Breastfed newborn infants whose mothers were taking oral metronidazole 3 times daily had blood samples taken 1 to 2 hours after a maternal dose. Eleven infants whose mothers were taking a dose of 600 mg daily had plasma metronidazole levels averaging 0.8 mg/L (range 0.3 to 1.4 mg/L) and hydroxymetronidazole levels averaging 0.4 mg/L (range 0.1 to 0.8 mg/L). Four infants whose mothers were taking 1200 mg daily had plasma metronidazole levels averaging 2.4 mg/L (range 0.6 to 4.9 mg/L) and hydroxymetronidazole levels averaging 1.1 mg/L (range 0.4 to 2.3 mg/L). The infants had plasma metronidazole levels ranging from 4 to 32% of maternal plasma levels and plasma hydroxymetronidazole ranging from 8 to 96% of maternal plasma levels.[10] Seven breastfed infants whose mothers were taking oral metronidazole 400 mg 3 times daily had serum levels measured 4 to 8 hours after a maternal dose and 30 to 90 minutes after breastfeeding. Their average plasma levels were 1.6 mg/L for metronidazole and 1.4 mg/L for hydroxymetronidazole. These levels corresponded to 12.5% and 25.6% of maternal metronidazole and hydroxymetronidazole plasma levels, respectively.[11]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "None of ten 5-day-old infants who were breastfed every 4 hours after a single maternal 200 mg oral dose of metronidazole had any signs of oral or gastrointestinal upset during the 12-hour study period.[7] Sixteen newborn breastfed infants (aged 0 to 22 days)  of mothers receiving 200 mg or 400 mg of oral metronidazole 3 times daily reportedly suffered no observable adverse reactions during the 9 days of the study.[10] A case of diarrhea and secondary lactose intolerance was possibly caused by metronidazole in breastmilk transmitted to the infant in the early neonatal period.[13] In a controlled, comparative study, 35 newborn infants were monitored for 10 days during maternal therapy with metronidazole and another antibiotic (33 ampicillin, 1 erythromycin and 1 cephalexin) for postpartum infection or prophylaxis. Dosages and routes of administration were not stated, but some mothers received the drugs intravenously initially and then were switched to oral therapy. Compared to infants of mothers who received ampicillin alone or no antibiotics, more infants exposed to metronidazole and ampicillin had very loose stools than in the other groups, especially when the drugs were given intravenously. More frequent and heavier growth of Candida species was found in the oral and perianal swabs of metronidazole-exposed infants, but this did not quite reach statistical significance (p=0.053). One infant exposed to metronidazole and ampicillin developed oral thrush. No differences were found between the groups in diaper rash, feeding problems or weight gain to the time of discharge.[11]"

Mesalamine is metabolized to N-acetyl-5-ASA which is inactive in treating inflammatory bowel disease, but its possible effects on the breastfed infant are unknown. Maternal Levels: A lactating woman with a long history of Crohn's disease and 2 bowel resections at her terminal ileum was given a single oral dose of olsalazine 500 mg at 4 months postpartum. She was also taking prednisone 17.5 mg daily at the time of the study. Milk samples were taken periodically from 30 minutes to 48 hours after the dose. Olsalazine and its metabolites, olsalazine sulfate and mesalamine were undetectable (  < 170 mcg/L) in milk at all times during the study. The inactive mesalamine metabolite, N-acetyl-5-ASA, was detectable only at 10, 14 and 24 hours after the dose in concentrations of 170, 183 and 264 mcg/L, respectively.[4] A woman taking olsalazine capsules 750 mg twice daily collected 5 breastmilk samples during one day 2 to 4 weeks postpartum. Mesalamine was undetectable (  < 20 mcg/L) in milk. N-acetyl-5-ASA averaged 2.3 mg/L (range 1.2 to 3.8 mg/L) in the 5 samples.

Although one expert panel recommends withholding nursing for an unspecified time after propofol administration,[1] most recommend that breastfeeding can be resumed as soon as the mother has recovered sufficiently from general anesthesia to nurse and that discarding milk is unnecessary.[2][3][4] When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. General anesthesia for cesarean section using propofol as a component for induction may delay the onset of lactation.<br><br>  In one case, milk was noted to be green in color 8 hours after a procedure in which propofol was administered; however, several other medications were also used during the procedure."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Five women who had undergone general anesthesia with propofol intravenously shortly after delivery had colostrum propofol levels measured. All of the women received 2 mg/kg intravenously over 20 seconds at time zero followed by a continuous infusion. In 3 women who received 0.25 to 0.37 mg/kg/minute, propofol was detectable in colostrum, but not quantifiable because of technical difficulties. In a woman who received 0.42 mg/kg/minute for 7 minutes, the highest colostrum level was 1.53 mg/L at 15 minutes after the start of the infusion. Colostrum levels decreased to 0.12 mg/L over the next 8 hours. Another woman who received 0.18 mg/kg/minute for 6 hours, the highest colostrum level was 4.91 mg/L at 30 minutes after the start of the infusion.[5] Four women received a single intravenous bolus dose of propofol 2.5 mg/kg prior to cesarean section. Colostrum levels averaged 0.17 mg/L (range 0.14 to 0.24 mg/L) in 3 of the women 4 hours after the dose and 0.14 mg/L (range 0.089 to 0.19 mg/L) in 4 of the women 8 hours after the dose. In the same report, 3 women received a bolus dose of propofol 2.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 5 mg/kg/hour. In one patient, colostrum level was 0.33 mg/L at 4 hours after the bolus; a second patient had levels of 0.74 mg/L at 5 hours and 0.048 mg/L at 8 hours after the bolus; a third patient had a colostrum level of 0.036 mg/L at 6 hours after the bolus.[2] Five women who were 6 to 15 weeks postpartum were given a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg of propofol intravenously before undergoing general anesthesia. Several milk samples were collected between 5 and 24 hours after the injection from each woman. The authors estimated that the infants would receive an average of 0.0052 mg/kg in the 24 hours after a single dose of propofol. This corresponds to 0.02% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. The women's milk output following the surgical procedure was less than half of the normal milk output of nursing mothers. The authors concluded that this amount of propofol in milk is unlikely to affect a healthy, term infant.[3] The infants of mothers not undergoing a surgical procedure might receive a greater dose of propofol in breastmilk, but it would be unlikely to be a large dose. A woman received 474 mg of propofol by controlled infusion during a procedure to terminate an ectopic pregnancy. The first milk she pumped 8 hours after the procedure was green in color. Although the authors suspect that propofol was the cause of the discoloration, the woman had also received several other medications during the procedure. Thirty hours later, propofol was detected in a milk sample at a concentration of 24 mcg/L, completely as unconjugated propofol.[6] Two mothers who were breastfeeding their infants were given propofol doses that targeted a serum concentration of 6.5 mcg/L for anesthesia induction. Propofol was stopped as xenon anesthesia was started. One mother received a total of 350 mg of propofol intravenously and had an operative time of 35 minutes. Her milk propofol level was 0.13 mg/L at 300 minutes after extubation. The other mother received a total of 443 mg of propofol intravenously and had an operative time of 35 minutes. Her milk propofol level was 2.78 mg/L at 90 minutes after  extubation and 0.84 mg/L 300 minutes after extubation.[7] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Four mothers who were breastfeeding their infants received propofol as part of their general anesthesia for surgical procedures. All patients also received intravenous remifentanil and rocuronium, and inhaled xenon as part of the anesthesia. They were given doses of propofol that targeted a serum concentration of 6.5 mcg/L for induction and stopped as xenon anesthesia was started. Operation times ranged from 35 to 45 minutes. Individual infants were first breastfed as follows: 1.5 hours, 2.8 hours, 4.6 hours, and 5 hours after extubation. No signs of sedation were observed in any of the infants.[7]"

General anesthesia was performed using propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg for induction, followed by sevoflurane and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg as needed. Fentanyl 1 to 1.5 mcg/kg was administered after delivery. Patients in the general anesthesia group (n = 21) had higher post-procedure prolactin levels and a longer mean time to lactation initiation (25 hours) than in the other groups (10.8 to 11.8 hours). Postpartum oxytocin levels in the nonmedicated vaginal delivery group were higher than in the general and spinal anesthesia groups.[8]"

Sulfasalazine milk levels averaged 2.7 mg/L, total sulfapyridine (including all metabolites) averaged 10.3 mg/L and free sulfapyridine (not including metabolites) was 6.5 mg/L. Mesalamine and its metabolites were not measured.[4] Twelve patients with inflammatory bowel disease were started on sulfasalazine 3 weeks postpartum and had breastmilk levels taken 2 to 3 weeks later. Of 31 samples in the 12 women, only 5 samples had detectable (  > 1 mg/L) sulfasalazine levels, ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/L with dosages of 1 or 2 grams of sulfasalazine daily. Eight of the patients had 16 untimed milk levels measured while taking dosages of 1 to 3 grams daily. Milk sulfapyridine levels ranged from 1 to 38 mg/L, with some correlation to dosage. Almost no sulfapyridine metabolites were found in milk.[5]A woman began taking sulfasalazine 500 mg 4 times daily at 4.5 months postpartum for ulcerative colitis. She provided milk samples on 8 days over the next 2 months. A total of 44 samples were obtained, including 10 on the first day of medication. Other samples were obtained midway between nursing bouts which occurred about ever 4 hours. Sulfasalazine was not found in any of the milk samples. Sulfapyridine appeared in milk 4 hours after the first dose in a concentration of 4.8 mg/L. Over the next 2 weeks, sulfapyridine levels fluctuated in the range of 3.9 to 6.6 mg/L and acetylsulfapyridine levels were in the range of 0.4 to 2 mg/L. Total sulfapyridine plus metabolites were in the range of 3.2 to 13 mg/L with most values between 5 and 8 mg/L. Mesalamine was not detected in breastmilk.[6] Three women who were taking sulfasalazine 3 grams daily for ulcerative colitis each had a single milk level measured 3 to 4 days postpartum. Sampling time in relation to the dose was not reported. Sulfasalzaine levels ranged from   < 0.5 mg/L to 1.2 mg/L; sulfapyridine levels ranged from 9 to 16.9 mg/L; acetylsulfapyridine levels ranged from 1.1 to 6.7 mg/L. Mesalamine levels were uniformly 0.02 mg/L and N-acetyl-5ASA levels ranged from 1.2 to 3.4 mg/L.[7] Eight women were taking sulfasalazine during pregnancy and postpartum in an average dosage of 2.6 grams daily. Milk samples were taken 2 hours after breastfeeding, but times in relation to a dose were not stated. Sulfasalazine was undetectable (  < 0.5 to 1 mg/L) in all but one milk sample in which it was 4.1 mg/L. Sulfapyridine levels in 7 of the samples ranged from 12 to 60 mg/L.[8] Infant Levels: The breastfed infant of a mother taking sulfasalazine 500 mg 4 times daily had levels of sulfapyridine plus metabolites measured in urine 3 times during 2.5 months of therapy, beginning at 4.5 months postpartum. Total sulfapyridine plus metabolites ranged from 3 to 4.1 mg/L, with most of the drug appearing as metabolites. No mesalamine was detected in the infant's urine.[6] A 3-month-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking sulfasalazine 3 grams daily had a sulfapyridine blood level of 5.3 mg/L. The infant's mother was a slow acetylator, but the infant's acetylator status was not determined.[9] Eight breastfed infants whose mothers were taking sulfasalazine in an average dosage of 2.6 grams daily had serum levels measured once between 2 and 24 weeks of age. Sulfasalazine serum levels were undetectable (  < 0.5 to 1 mg/L) in 6 infants. In the other 2 infants, sulfasalazine serum levels were 1 and 1.7 mg/L. Sulfapyridine was detectable in 5 infants' serum in levels ranging from 1 to 4.8 mg/L.[8]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "One group of investigators stated that they had 10 years of experience using sulfasalazine during the puerperium with no obvious adverse effects in breastfed infants.[4] The breastfed infant of a mother taking sulfasalazine 500 mg 4 times daily beginning at 4.5 months postpartum experienced no adverse effects during 2.5 months of nursing.[6] A 2-month-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking sulfasalazine 3 grams daily had an episode of bloody diarrhea. The bloody diarrhea recurred 2 weeks later and persisted until 3 months of age. The infant had up to 6 bowel movements daily and the stools had a loose consistency and were mixed with fresh blood. A colonoscopy revealed a mild inflammatory process and numerous punctate erosions in the mucosa. The infant had a sulfapyridine blood level of 5.3 mg/L, which may have been enhanced because the infant's mother was a slow acetylator. The bloody diarrhea stopped 48 to 72 hours after the mother stopped taking sulfasalazine. A repeat colonoscopy at 4.5 months of age was normal and no further bloody diarrhea occurred up to 14 months of follow-up. The authors felt that the reaction was likely caused by an allergic reaction to sulfapyridine.[9] The reaction was probably caused by sulfasalazine or one of its metabolites in breastmilk. Both sulfapyridine and mesalamine have been reported to cause diarrhea in breastfed infants.[10][11] Eight infants whose mothers were taking sulfasalazine in average dosage of 2.6 grams daily were breastfed. Sulfapyridine was detectable in 5 infant's serum in levels ranging from 1 to 4.8 mg/L. The authors pointed out that these levels were far below those required to displace bilirubin from serum albumin binding sites.[8] A small controlled study reported only in abstract form found no higher rate of diarrhea in the breastfed infants of mothers taking mesalamine or sulfasalazine than in control infants.[12] A woman with Crohn's disease used sulfasalazine 4 g/day during pregnancy and postpartum. During breastfeeding (extent not stated) she also received infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks and prednisone 60 mg/day in a tapering schedule. At 6 months of age, the infant was asymptomatic with regular weight gain.[13]"

During the infusion and 25 minutes after its initiation and about 800 mg had been given, a milk level of 7.5 mg/L was measured. A second milk sample taken 14 minutes after completion of the infusion of a total of 1125 mg contained 20 mg/L.[3] The accuracy and specificity of this old analytic technique were not well defined. Four women who received intravenous thiopental for anesthesia induction prior to cesarean section had breastmilk samples taken on days 1 and 2 postpartum. Exact doses were not specified, but were in the range of 200 to 500 mg. The average milk concentrations were 1.96 mg/L on day 1 and 0.55 mg/L on day 2.[4] Eight women admitted for cesarean section were given an average of 5 mg/kg (range 3.8 to 6.3 mg/kg) of intravenous thiopental for induction of anesthesia. The highest colostrum level occurred in the first nursing after the termination of anesthesia (about 4 hours after the dose) and was estimated to be 0.34 mg/L. Eight other women who were at least 2 weeks postpartum were given an average of 5.4 mg/kg (range 4.4 to 7 mg/kg) of intravenous thiopental for induction of anesthesia. The highest milk level occurred in the first nursing after the termination of anesthesia (about 4 hours after the dose) and was estimated to be 0.9 mg/L. The authors concluded that the doses received by the infant were negligible and unlikely to affect the infant.[1] Twenty women undergoing cesarean section received 5 mg/kg of thiopental intravenously for induction of anesthesia. Average colostrum levels were 1.98 mg/L (range 0.6 to 4.7 mg/L) at 30 minutes, 0.91 mg/L (range 0.4 to 1.9 mg/L) at 4 hours, and 0.59 mg/L (range 0.3 to 1.4 mg/L) at 9 hours after the end of the dose.[5] Infant Levels: Seven mothers received intravenous thiopental for anesthesia induction prior to cesarean section. The half-lives of the drug were calculated in their infants from urinary excretion data. The breastfed infants excreted an average of 0.0067% of the maternal dose in their urine while the nonbreastfed infants excreted an average of 0.008% in their urine. The half-lives of thiopental in the 4 infants who were breastfed was not different from those in the 3 formula-fed infants. These findings indicate that trivial amounts of thiopental are received in breastmilk by infants in the first 2 days of life after administration th their mothers during delivery.[4]"

The time to the first breastfeed was significantly shorter (107 vs 228 minutes) with the epidural anesthesia than with general anesthesia. This difference was probably caused by the anesthesia's effects on the infant, because the Apgar and neurologic and adaptive scores were significantly lower in the general anesthesia group of infants.[6]"

No studies have evaluated adverse effects of tinidazole on the infant during breastfeeding, but presumably they are similar to those of the closely related drug, metronidazole, such as increased risk of oral and rectal <em>Candida</em> infections.<br><br>  As with metronidazole, concern has been raised about exposure of healthy infants to tinidazole via breastmilk,[1] because of possible mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. Opinions vary among experts on the advisability of using tinidazole during longer-term therapy while breastfeeding, but avoidance of breastfeeding for 3 days after a single dose should allow milk levels to drop to negligible values.[2] Other drugs are available for some conditions that tinidazole is used to treat."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Three women were given tinidazole 150 orally twice daily starting on day 4 postpartum. On day 7, milk samples were collected at 2, 5 and 9 hours after a dose. Breastmilk concentrations ranged between 5.8 and 12.7 mg/L.[3] Twenty-four women who delivered by cesarean section were given a single intravenous dose of tinidazole 500 mg after cord clamping. Colostrum levels of tinidazole averaged 5.8 mg/L at 12 hours after the dose, 3.5 mg/L at 24 hours, 1.2 mg/L at 48 hours and 0.3 mg/L at 72 hours after the dose. The drug was barely detectable 96 hours after the dose. Only slight differences existed between concentrations in fore- and hindmilk.[4] Five women who delivered by cesarean section were given a single intravenous dose of tinidazole 1600 mg after cord clamping. Milk concentrations and volumes were measured for 96 hours after the dose. The authors concluded that milk concentrations would be sufficiently low to commence breastfeeding 72 hours after the dose.[2] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Because of the low levels of bupivacaine in breastmilk, and it is not orally absorbed, amounts received by the infant are small and it has not caused any adverse effects in breastfed infants.<br><br>  Bupivacaine <em>during</em> labor and delivery with other anesthetics and analgesics has been reported by some to interfere with breastfeeding. However, this assessment is controversial and complex because of the many different combinations of drugs, dosages and patient populations studied as well as the variety of techniques used and deficient design of many of the studies. In contrast, epidural bupivacaine begun <em>after</em> clamping of the umbilical cord appears to enhance breastfeeding success because of improved pain control. Overall it appears that with good breastfeeding support epidural bupivacaine with or without fentanyl has little or no adverse effect on breastfeeding success.[1][2][3][4] Labor pain medication may delay the onset of lactation."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Bupivacaine milk levels were measured in 5 women who were given epidural bupivacaine analgesia (dosage not stated) for vaginal delivery. Bupivacaine was undetectable (  < 20 mcg/L) in all samples taken at 2, 8, 24 and 48 hours postpartum.[5] One woman received bupivacaine 50 mg intrapleurally, followed in 1 hour by a continuous infusion of 25 mg/hour for 5 days for operative and postoperative analgesia. Four milk samples were taken during the infusion. The milk bupivacaine level was 400 mcg/L at 6 hours after the bolus dose and approximately 200 mcg/L at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the bolus dose.[6] Twenty-two women received epidural lidocaine 2% and bupivacaine 0.5% for pain control during cesarean delivery. Lidocaine dosage averaged 82 mg (range 25 to 168 mg). Average milk bupivacaine concentrations were 90 mcg/L at 2 hours after delivery, 60 mcg/L at 4 hours after delivery and 40 mcg/L at 12 hours after delivery.[7] Twenty women undergoing cesarean section deliveries with epidural anesthesia were randomized to receive either bupivacaine 0.5% (n = 10) or levobupivacaine 0.5% (n = 10) in a single-blinded study. The drugs were given as 0.5 mL (2.5 mg) boluses as needed up to 150 mg (mean 82.5 mg). Blood and milk samples were obtained before and 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours after administration of the drugs. Bupivacaine was detected in breastmilk 30 minutes after administration, with the peak milk concentration of about 0.2 mg/L occurring at about 2 hours after administration. Levobupivacaine was almost at baseline level by 7 hours and absent from milk (  < 5 mcg/L) by 24 hours after the dose. The passage of levobupivacaine into breastmilk was virtually identical.[8] Infant Levels. One woman who was 10 months postpartum received bupivacaine 50 mg intrapleurally, followed in 1 hour by a continuous intrapleural infusion of 25 mg/hour for 5 days for operative and postoperative analgesia. Breastfeeding resumed postoperatively 22 hours after the start of the infusion. A serum sample taken from the infant 5 hours after the morning feeding on day 3 postoperatively (52.5 hours after the bolus dose) contained undetectable (lower limit not stated) amounts of bupivacaine by gas chromatography.[6]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Bupivacaine administered to the mother by intrapleural or epidural routes had no effect on 13 breastfed infants.[7]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Thirty women who delivered by cesarean section received either spinal anesthesia (not defined) alone (n = 15) or spinal anesthesia plus bupivacaine (n = 15) by extradural infusion after clamping the umbilical cord. A bupivacaine bolus of 12.5 mg was followed by a continuous infusion of 17.5 mg/hour for 3 days postpartum. Patients who received bupivacaine had better pain relief as indicated by lower pain scores and a lower consumption of supplemental diclofenac for pain. Bupivacaine-treated patients also produced more milk per day than the untreated women, a difference that was statistically significant from day 3 to the end of the study on day 11 postpartum. The authors concluded that improved pain relief improved breastfeeding performance.[9] Twenty women who delivered by cesarean section received either bupivacaine alone or bupivacaine plus buprenorphine by extradural infusion after clamping the umbilical cord. A bupivacaine bolus of 12.5 mg was followed by a continuous infusion of 17.5 mg/hour for 3 days. The buprenorphine was given as a bolus of 200 mcg followed by 8.4 mcg/hour for 3 days. Patients started breastfeeding as soon as they were able to sit up. Both the amount of milk fed and infant weight increased in both groups over the first 10 days postpartum; however, the increases were greater in those who received bupivacaine alone.[7][10] A prospective cohort study compared women who received no analgesia (n = 63) to women who received continuous epidural analgesia with fentanyl and either bupivacaine 0.05 to 0.1% (n = 39) or ropivacaine (n = 13) during labor and delivery. The total dosage of bupivacaine was 31 to 62 mg and the average total infusion time from start to delivery was 219 minutes. The study found no differences between the groups in breastfeeding effectiveness or infant neurobehavioral status at 8 to 12 hours postpartum or the number exclusively or partially breastfeeding at 4 weeks postpartum.[11]A randomized, prospective study measured infant breastfeeding behavior following epidural or  intravenous fentanyl during delivery in 100 multiparous mothers undergoing cesarean section and delivering fullterm, healthy infants. The epidural group received epidural bupivacaine 100 mg initially, followed by a continuous infusion of 25 mg/hour. The intravenous fentanyl group received a spinal injection of 15 to 20 mg of bupivacaine. A slight difference was seen in breastfeeding behavior between the groups, with the infants in the intravenous fentanyl group performing slightly worse than those in the epidural group. However, all mothers were able to breastfeed their infants at 24 hours. None had severe breastfeeding problems; 10 women in the epidural group reported mild or moderate problems and 7 women in the intravenous group reported breastfeeding problems. Twenty mothers in the epidural group and 14 in the intravenous group used supplemental bottle feeding, with the difference not statistically significant.[12]A randomized, but nonblinded, study in women undergoing cesarean section compared epidural anesthesia with bupivacaine to general anesthesia with intravenous thiopental 4 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg for induction followed by nitrous oxide and isoflurane. The time to the first breastfeed was significantly shorter (107 vs 228 minutes) with the epidural anesthesia than with general anesthesia. This difference was probably caused by the anesthesia's effects on the infant, because the Apgar and neurologic and adaptive scores were significantly lower in the general anesthesia group of infants.[13] A randomized, multicenter trial compared the initiation rate and duration of breastfeeding in women who received high-dose epidural bupivacaine alone, or one of two low-dose combinations of bupivacaine plus fentanyl. A nonepidural matched control group was also compared. No differences in breastfeeding initiation rates or duration were found among the epidural and nonmedicated, nonepidural groups.[14] A nonrandomized study in low-risk mother-infant pairs found that there was no difference overall in the amount of sucking by newborns, whether their mothers received bupivacaine plus fentanyl, or fentanyl alone by epidural infusion in various dosages, or received no analgesia for childbirth. In a subanalysis by sex and number of sucks, female infants were affected by high-dose bupivacaine and high-dose fentanyl, but male infant were not.[15] However, the imbalance of many factors between the study groups makes this study difficult to interpret. In a prospective cohort study, 87 multiparous women who received epidural bupivacaine and fentanyl for pain control during labor and vaginal delivery. A loading dose of 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 50-100 mcg. Epidural analgesia is maintained using 0.0625% bupivacaine and fentanyl 0.2 mcg/mL. The median dose of fentanyl received by the women was 151 mcg (range 30 to 570 mcg). The women completed questionnaires at 1 and 6 weeks postpartum regarding breastfeeding. Most women had prior experience with breastfeeding, support at home and ample time off from work. All women were breastfeeding at 1 week postpartum and 95.4% of women were breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum.[16] A national survey of women and their infants from late pregnancy through 12 months postpartum compared the time of lactogenesis II in mothers who did and did not receive pain medication during labor. Categories of medication were spinal or epidural only, spinal or epidural plus another medication, and other pain medication only. Women who received medications from any of the categories had about twice the risk of having delayed lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) compared to women who received no labor pain medication.[17] A randomized study compared the effects of cesarean section using general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, or epidural anesthesia, to normal vaginal delivery on serum prolactin and oxytocin as well as time to initiation of lactation. Spinal anesthesia used bupivacaine 10 to 11 mg of hypertonic 5% bupivacaine solution and epidural anesthesia used 10 mL (50 mg) of 0.5% bupivacaine. After delivery, patients in all groups received an infusion of oxytocin 30 international units in 1 L of saline, and 0.2 mg of methylergonovine if they were not hypertensive. Patients in the general anesthesia group (n = 21) had higher post-procedure prolactin levels and a longer mean time to lactation initiation (25 hours) than in the other groups (10.8 to 11.8 hours). Postpartum oxytocin levels in the nonmedicated vaginal delivery group were higher than in the general and spinal anesthesia groups and serum oxytocin in the epidural group were higher than those in the spinal group.[18]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Cabergoline is usually not used during breastfeeding because it suppresses lactation. The US Food and Drug Administration considers cabergoline to be not indicated to suppress lactation because the similar drug bromocriptine has caused hypertension, stroke and seizures when used for this purpose. Cabergoline's use in other conditions has caused side effects similar to other dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine. Whether rare cases of severe adverse effects occur with cabergoline as with bromocriptine cannot be determined because of the small number of postpartum patients treated in clinical trials to date. However, limited experience from clinical trials indicates that a single oral dose of 1 mg of cabergoline causes fewer side effects (usually headache, dizziness and nausea) than 14 days of bromocriptine and is at least as effective when used to suppress unwanted lactation. The disadvantage of cabergoline is that it has a half-life of about 68 hours, which means that any adverse effects will persist for a prolonged period of time. Women treated with cabergoline for pituitary adenomas who become pregnant can breastfed their infants with no apparent risk of recurrence. A treatment scheme has been reported for mothers with hypergalactia that uses low doses of cabergoline to decrease milk supply.[1][2]"

    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Seventeen women who did not wish to breastfeed received a placebo or a single oral dose of cabergoline 400 mcg or 600 mcg on day 2 or 3 postpartum. Use of other lactation suppressing measures (e.g., breast binding, lack of nipple stimulation) was not mentioned. Blood samples were taken periodically over the next 96 hours. In the 7 women who received 400 mcg, plasma prolactin levels were decreased at 24 and 48 hours, but 4 developed breast engorgement. In the 5 women who received 600 mcg, plasma prolactin levels were decreased by 12 hours and persisted up to 96 hours and none developed breast engorgement. Some women had minor decreases in blood pressure, but no other adverse effects were reported.[3] Thirty-two women who did not wish to breastfeed were given placebo or cabergoline 400, 600 or 800 mcg within 24 hours after delivery in a double-blind trial. Use of other lactation suppressing measures (e.g., breast binding, lack of nipple stimulation) was not mentioned. Lactation was prevented in 4 of 8 women who received the 400 mcg dose and all women who received the 600 or 800 mcg dose. Only 1 of 8 women receiving placebo had cessation of lactation by day 14 postpartum. Serum prolactin levels collected on days 2, 3 and 4 of treatment were decreased significantly in all women who received cabergoline, but the decreases were not statistically different among the various doses.[4] A prospective, randomized, double-blinded study compared the effects of a single dose of cabergoline 0.5, 0.75 or 1 mg in 40 women each and to 20 women who received a placebo. The drug was given in the first 24 hours postpartum and use of other lactation suppressing measures (e.g., breast binding, lack of nipple stimulation) was not mentioned. The adequacy of lactation suppression on day 14 postpartum was dose-related, with excellent results in 18 patients who receive 0.5 mg, 28 who received 0.75 mg and 36 who received 1 mg. Serum prolactin levels collected during 13 days of treatment were decreased significantly in all women who received cabergoline, but the decreases were not statistically different among the various doses. Adverse effects included occasional dizziness and headache between days 1 and 3 after the dose.[5] In a single-blind trial, 36 women were given either a single oral dose of cabergoline 1 mg or oral bromocriptine 2.5 mg twice daily for 14 days, starting about 50 hours after cesarean section. Use of other lactation suppressing measures (e.g., breast binding, lack of nipple stimulation) was not mentioned. Another 13 women who were breastfeeding after cesarean section served as controls. Both cabergoline and bromocriptine suppressed baseline serum prolactin by about 90% compared to baseline and control women within 3 days; this persisted at least through day 7, but somewhat rebounded by day 14. Suppression of lactation as measured by milk secretion, tenderness, and engorgement was equal between the 2 treatment groups. Lactation suppression was complete in 17 of 18 women who received cabergoline and 16 of 18 women who received bromocriptine, although the response was more rapid with cabergoline. Adverse events from cabergoline were fewer in number than with bromocriptine and consisted of occasional headache lasting 2 days, dizziness, and vomiting.[6] A well-designed and evaluated double-blind study compared oral cabergoline 1 mg in a single dose (n = 136) to oral bromocriptine 2.5 mg twice daily for 14 days (n = 136) in women within 27 hours postpartum. Some women in each group (cabergoline n = 18; bromocriptine n = 16) received an ergot alkaloid or oral contraceptive postpartum. Symptoms of milk production and engorgement were recorded by the women and serum prolactin levels were measured on 3 occasions during the first 2 to 3 weeks postpartum. Cabergoline was at least as effective as bromocriptine, with complete success in 78% of cabergoline patients and 69% of bromocriptine patients. The rate of rebound lactation was much higher in bromocriptine patients (24%) than in cabergoline patients (5%). Serum prolactin was suppressed in both groups, but rebound was more common with bromocriptine on days 15 and 21. Adverse effects were numerically, but not statistically less frequent in cabergoline patients, with the most frequent being dizziness, headache, nausea and epigastric pain.[7] Cabergoline was evaluated for lactation suppression in a prospective, but nonrandomized, unblinded trial. Women who were within 24 hours postpartum were given a single 1 mg dose (n = 54); those who were beyond 24 hours were given 0.25 mg twice daily for 2 days (n = 46). Only composite results were given for the entire group of 100 women. Mean serum prolactin dropped from 181.4 mcg/L (range 153 to 213 mcg/L) on the first day to 12.5 mcg/L (range 0.9 to 37 mcg/L) on day 4, and 18.2 mcg/L (range 2 to 36.2 mcg/L) on day 14 after the dose. Lactation was completely inhibited in 92% of women; 8 women required a second doses of 1 mg to inhibit lactation. Twenty-six percent of women had side effects such as dizziness, headache, nausea and abdominal pain. In 4% of women, side effects were severe enough to require symptomatic treatment.[7][8] In a prospective, nonrandomized, unblinded trial, 43 women who underwent a second trimester abortion were given cabergoline 1 mg orally to suppress lactation. A single dose was effective in 88% of women.[9] A randomized, nonblinded trial compared cabergoline 0.5 mg (n = 80) and 1 mg (n = 80) orally in a single dose given at an unstated time in the early postpartum period. The 1 mg dose was more effective in suppressing lactation than the 0.5 mg dose. Headache and nausea were the most common adverse effects.[10] A follow-up survey was conducted on 91 women who became pregnant after treatment with cabergoline for hyperprolactinemia from pituitary adenomas. Eighty-eight patient breastfed their infants, 35 for less than 2 months and 56 for 2 to 6 months. No patients were restarted on cabergoline after pregnancy. At 3 and 12 months after pregnancy, serum prolactin was slightly higher than prepregnancy levels, but by 60 months postpartum, prolactin levels were lower than prepregnancy levels. Mothers who nursed for more than 2 months had lower serum prolactin at 60 months after cessation of breastfeeding than those who breastfed for less than 2 months. The authors concluded that breastfeeding does not increase the risk of recurrence of hyperprolactinemia.[11]"

The authors expressed concern that repeated doses of ergonovine could suppress lactation.[1] Ten women who were given ergonovine 0.2 mg 3 times daily from day 1 to 7 postpartum were compared to 6 women who did not receive the drug. None of the women breastfed their infants. Serum prolactin levels were significantly lower in the treated women by day 2 postpartum and persisted through the 7 days of the study. Seven of the 10 treated women developed breast engorgement and had milk letdown and 3 had progressive inhibition of lactation. In 2 additional women who were nursing their infants, a single dose of 0.2 mg of ergonovine intravenously blunted the response of serum prolactin to suckling.[2] In a nonrandomized study, 11 women with normal deliveries were given an intramuscular injection of either oxytocin 5 units plus ergonovine 0.5 mg (n = 5)  or 5 units of oxytocin alone (n = 6). Serum prolactin levels were lower in the women given ergonovine from 0.5 to 2.5 hours.[3] In a randomized, but nonblinded, controlled trial, women thought to be at low risk of postpartum hemorrhage were given either ergonovine 0.5 mg intravenously following birth of the infant (n = 197) or no drug (n = 135). Serum prolactin levels obtained in the period of 48 to 72 hours postpartum did not differ between the groups, but fewer of those who received ergonovine were still breastfeeding at 4 weeks postpartum than those who did not.[4] In a randomized, but nonblinded, controlled trial, women thought to be at low risk of postpartum hemorrhage were given either ergonovine 0.5 mg intravenously following birth of the infant (n = 197) or no drug (n = 135). Serum prolactin levels obtained in the period of 48 to 72 hours postpartum did not differ between the groups, but fewer of those who received ergonovine were still breastfeeding at 4 weeks postpartum than those who did not.[4] A retrospective  review of obstetrical records of 18,165 records of mothers giving birth in Wales found that use of intravenous or intramuscular ergonovine during the third stage of labor as a uterotonic reduced the odds of the mother breastfeeding at 48 hours postpartum. The reduction was 36% in the overall sample and 49% for primiparous mothers.[5]"

    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In one uncontrolled study, 6-beta-hydroxycortisol levels were measured in 10 male infants whose mothers had tuberculosis and took ethambutol 1 gram daily plus isoniazid 300 mg daily and the infants of mothers (apparently without tuberculosis) who took no chronic drug therapy. The infants of mothers taking the antituberculars had consistently lower 6-beta-hydroxycortisol levels on 8 occasions at 15-day intervals from 90 to 195 days of age, but these differences were statistically significant on days 120 and 195 only. The authors attributed the lower levels to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cortisol to 6-beta-hydroxycortisol by the antitubercular drugs in milk.[6] However, ethambutol is not known to inhibit drug metabolism, so if the effect occurs it is more likely caused by isoniazid. One woman taking rifampin 450 mg, isoniazid 300 mg and ethambutol 1200 mg daily during pregnancy and rifampin 450 mg and isoniazid 300 mg for the first 7 months of lactation (extent not stated).

Infliximab was not detectable in breastmilk with an ELISA assay (assay sensitivity not specified) at 6, 10 or 13 weeks postpartum.[13] A woman with severe Crohn's disease received infliximab 1000 mg (10 mg/kg) intravenously every 4 weeks during pregnancy and lactation. She received a dose on an unstated day postpartum and breastmilk samples were collected daily (times not stated) once before and daily for 30 days after the dose. None of the samples had detectable infliximab (  < 5 mcg/L) using an ELISA assay.[14]Three women with Crohn's disease received infliximab during pregnancy and postpartum. Single breastmilk samples were obtained from each woman after a postpartum dose of 5 mg/kg of infliximab. Samples were collected 7, 5, and 43 days, respectively, after their prior dose. Infliximab was undetectable (  < 100 mcg/L) in all breastmilk samples.[15] Three women with Crohn's disease received an intravenous infusion of infliximab 5 mg/kg postpartum for a disease flare and discontinued nursing. Milk samples were obtained before and after the infusion. Milk samples were also obtained from 8 nursing mothers who did not receive infliximab. Infliximab was undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) in all of the pre-infusion samples and in those from the untreated mothers. Infliximab was detected in breastmilk samples obtained after the infusion in all 3 women. Infliximab was detectable 12 hours after the infusion and peaked at 75 to 105 mcg/L at 2 to 3 days after the infusion in 2 patients. In a third, one sample obtained 2 days after the infusion was about 20 mcg/L. The assay used in this series was more sensitive than those used previously and allowed the very low infliximab concentrations to be measured.[1]Two mothers received infliximab 300 mg intravenously for inflammatory bowel disease. Breastmilk infliximab was 200 mcg/L in one mother (time after dose not stated), which was about 4.3% of her serum concentration. The second mother began infliximab at 3 months postpartum. Her breastmilk infliximab levels were 94.6 mcg/L on day 1 after the first dose and 119.7 mcg/L on day 4 after the dose.[16] Three women with inflammatory bowel disease who received postpartum infliximab infusions (doses not specified) had milk samples analyzed for the drug for 5 days after the infusion. The assay method was somewhat unreliable in this study. In the first patient, infliximab was detectable in breastmilk only on days 4 and 6 after the infusion, with values of about 100 mcg/L. After the second infusion, the highest milk concentration of about 130 mcg/L occurred after about 30 hours. Subsequent levels were lower over the next 5 days. In a second patient, infliximab was found in milk shortly after the infusion with the highest concentration of 300 mcg/L occurring at 3.3 days after the dose. A third patient had detectable infliximab in milk on days 2 and 4, with the highest level of about 100 mcg/L on day 4.[17] Eleven women who received infliximab (dose unspecified) as part of a large registry study submitted breastmilk samples. Infliximab was detected in levels between 90 and 591 mcg/L between 24 and 48 hours after infusion.[18] Infant Levels: A woman with Crohn's disease received infliximab during pregnancy, with the last of five 10 mg/kg doses 2 weeks before delivery. Doses were also given 2 and 10 weeks postpartum. She breastfed her infant from birth to 6 weeks, discontinued breastfeeding for 3 weeks and then restarted breastfeeding (extent not stated) at week 11 postpartum. Maternal and infant serum infliximab levels were equal when they were first measured at 6 weeks postpartum. The infant's serum infliximab steadily decreased over the next 7 weeks. The authors concluded that the initial high infant serum level was from transplacental passage of infliximab because the drug was undetectable in milk and the serum level dropped despite breastfeeding.[13] Two infants were breastfed (extent not stated) by mothers who received 5 mg/kg doses of infliximab during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Infliximab was discontinued at or before 32 weeks of the pregnancy and restarted within 2 weeks postpartum. Infant serum samples were obtained 5 days after the mother's previous infliximab dose in one when the infant was 15 days old and 43 days after the mother's dose at 57 days of age in the other infant. Infliximab was undetectable (  < 100 mcg/L) in both infants' serum.[15]A woman exclusively breastfed her infant for 3 months, then received a single intravenous dose of infliximab 300 mg and began partially breastfeeding her infant. Four weeks after beginning infliximab and 5 days after the second infliximab dose, her infant had a serum concentration of 1.7 mg/L, which was 2.2% of the simultaneous maternal serum infliximab concentration.[16] An infant was born at week 37 of gestation to a mother with ulcerative colitis was receiving long-term therapy with mesalamine 4 grams daily throughout pregnancy received inductions series of infliximab 5 mg/kg in weeks 20 and 31 of pregnancy for disease flares. She continued to receive infliximab infusions every 8 to 12 weeks, while the baby was breastfed (extent not stated) until 14 weeks of age. The infant's infliximab serum concentration at 16 weeks after birth was 0.6 mg/L, but was undetectable (  < 0.05mg/L) at 28 weeks of age. The serum concentration at 16 weeks was judged to have been a result of placental passage of the drug from mother to infant.[19]"

At 6 months of age, the infant was asymptomatic with regular weight gain.[25] Two women received infliximab 300 mg intravenously for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. One woman nursed her infant (extent not stated) and the other began partial breastfeeding her infant at 3 months of age when infliximab was begun. She breastfed for approximately 5 weeks (2 doses) before discontinuing breastfeeding. At 22 and 18 months of age, respectively, neither infant had any signs of adverse drug reactions, allergic reactions or severe infections leading to hospitalization. The first infant had a low birth weight, but caught up and reached the 75th percentile at the age of 11 months. Developmental milestones were reached on time by both infants.[16] A prospective cohort study followed	pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease throughout pregnancy and for 12 months postpartum. Women were assigned to one of the following groups: unexposed (no thiopurines or anti-TNF agents); group A (azathioprine or mercaptopurine); group B (infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab) and group AB (both a thiopurine and an anti-TNF agent). Of 1052 women enrolled in the study, 72% breastfed their infants, although the extent and duration were not stated in the abstract. A total of 102 women were exposed to an anti-TNF agent and 59 were exposed to a thiopurine plus an anti-TNF agent. The use of an anti-TNF alone was not associated with any complication in the infants and their growth and development were normal throughout the 12 months. Infants exposed to both a thiopurine and an anti-TNF agent had a 50% increase in the number of infections between 9 and 12 months of age. The relationship of this increase with breastfeeding could not be determined from the available data.[26] A woman with ulcerative colitis was receiving long-term therapy with mesalamine 4 grams daily throughout pregnancy received inductions series of infliximab 5 mg/kg in weeks 20 and 31 of pregnancy for disease flares. She continued to receive infliximab infusions every 8 to 12 weeks, while the baby was breastfed (extent not stated) until 14 weeks of age. The infant received routine vaccinations (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, injectable polio, Haemophilus influenzae b, and pneumococcal vaccines) at 3, 5 and 12 months with no signs of adverse effects from them, or signs of allergic or infectious diseases. Development at 13 months of age was normal.[19]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other professional organizations state that breastfeeding should not be discouraged in women taking isoniazid. Nursing mothers who are taking isoniazid should take 25 mg of oral pyridoxine daily.[1][2][3] Because of the low levels of isoniazid in breastmilk and safe administration directly to infants, it is unlikely to cause adverse reactions in infants, but infants should be monitored for rare instances jaundice. Giving the maternal once-daily dose before the infant's longest sleep period will decrease the dose the infant receives. The amount of isoniazid in milk is insufficient to treat tuberculosis in the breastfed infant. If breastfed infants are treated with isoniazid, they should also receive pyridoxine 1 mg/kg daily.[4]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Thirty mothers (time postpartum not stated) were given a single oral dose of 200 mg of isoniazid and a single milk sample was taken from each mother at various times between 2 and 7 hours after the dose. An average peak milk level of 2.1 mg/L (range 1.7 to 2.3 mg/L) occurred in 6 women at 2 hours after the dose. By 7 hours after the dose the average milk level was 0.46 mg/L (range 0.3 to 0.6 mg/L) in 3 women.[5] Three mothers were given single oral isoniazid doses of 300 mg (5 mg/kg) and 600 mg (10 mg/kg). Peak isoniazid levels occurred 3 hours after the dose in all cases. Peak levels were 5.4 to 5.5 mg/L after 300 mg and 9 to 10.6 mg/L after 600 mg. At 12 hours after the dose, milk levels were undetectable (  < 0.25 mg/L) after the 300 mg dose and 0.25 to 0.5 mg/L after the 600 mg dose.[6] A lactating  mother (time postpartum not stated) was given a single oral 300 mg dose of isoniazid after weaning. Breastmilk was collected at various times during the next 24 hours. Peak milk levels of 16.6 mg/L of isoniazid occurred at 3 hours and 3.8 mg/L of acetylisoniazid occurred at 5 hours after the dose. Both were still detectable in milk at 24 hours. Half-lives in milk were 5.9 hours for isoniazid and 13.5 hours for acetylisoniazid. The authors estimated that a total of 7 mg would be excreted into milk in 24 hours.[7] Seven women with an average weight of 40 kg had been receiving isoniazid 300 mg once daily for at least 34 days. All women were also receiving rifampin and ethambutol. Blood and milk samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after a dose for analysis of isoniazid; metabolites were not measured. Peak milk isoniazid concentrations of 2 to 6.7 mg/L occurred 1 hour after the dose and dropped by about half by 4 hours after the dose. The authors calculated that a fully breastfed infant would receive a dose of 89.9 mcg/kg daily compared to a recommended infant dosage of 10 mg/kg daily. This dose is equivalent to 1.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[8] The data in the studies above indicate that the infant would be expected to receive about 0.3 to 1.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of isoniazid. Infant Levels: Isoniazid was detectable in the urine of 2 of 3 breastfed infants whose mothers were given a single oral dose of 600 mg. The total amount excreted by the infants over 24 hours was about 6.8 to 7 mg.[6] Metabolites were not measured."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In one uncontrolled study, 6-beta-hydroxycortisol levels were measured in 10 male infants whose mothers had tuberculosis and took ethambutol 1 gram daily plus isoniazid 300 mg daily and the infants of mothers (apparently without tuberculosis) who took no chronic drug therapy. The infants of mothers taking the antituberculars had consistently lower 6-beta-hydroxycortisol levels on 8 occasions at 15-day intervals from 90 to 195 days of age, but these differences were statistically significant on days 120 and 195 only. The authors attributed the lower levels to inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cortisol to 6-beta-hydroxycortisol by the antitubercular drugs in milk.[9] However, ethambutol is not known to inhibit drug metabolism, so if the effect occurs it is more likely caused by isoniazid. One woman taking rifampin 450 mg, isoniazid 300 mg and ethambutol 1200 mg daily during pregnancy and rifampin 450 mg and isoniazid 300 mg for the first 7 months of lactation (extent not stated). The infant was born with mildly elevated serum liver enzymes which persisted for to 1 (alanine transferase) to 2 years (aspartate transaminase), but had no other adverse reactions.[10] Isoniazid was used as part of multi-drug regimens to treat 2 pregnant women with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum. Their two infants were breastfed (extent and duration not stated). At age 3.9 and 4.6 years, the children were developing normally except for a mild speech delay in one.[11] Two mothers in Turkey were diagnosed with tuberculosis at the 30th and 34th weeks of pregnancy. They immediately started isoniazid 300 mg, rifampin 600 mg, pyridoxine 50 mg daily for 6 months, plus pyrazinamide 25 mg/kg and ethambutol 25 mg/kg daily for 2 months. Both mothers breastfed their infants (extent not stated). Their infants were given isoniazid 5 mg/kg daily for 3 months prophylactically. Tuberculin skin tests were negative after 3 months and neither infant had tuberculosis at 1 year of age. No adverse effects of the drugs were mentioned.[12]"

Several studies indicate that levodopa can decrease serum prolactin during lactation. The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. The effect of long-term use of levodopa on breastfeeding has not been adequately evaluated, although one mother was able to successfully breastfeed her infant without apparent harm while using relatively low doses of levodopa and carbidopa for Parkinson's disease."

At 4.5 months postpartum, milk levodopa levels were measured after a morning dose of the drug. The peak levodopa milk level occurred 3 hours after the dose at a concentration of 315 mcg/L and returned to baseline of about 200 mcg/L 6 hours after the dose. On a different day, the same mother was given a single dose of immediate-release levodopa 200 mg and carbidopa 50 mg. The peak levodopa milk level occurred 3 hours after the dose at a concentration of 683 mcg/L and returned to baseline of about 220 mcg/L 6 hours after the dose. The infant was breastfed and weighed before and after each feeding. The infant ingested 0.127 mg and 0.181 mg of levodopa after maternal intake of the sustained- and immediate-release products, respectively.[1] Using data in the article, the infant would received an average of about 0.3% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage with the sustained release product and 0.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage with the immediate-release product.

Bromocriptine suppressed basal serum prolactin to a greater extent than levodopa. Over the next 3 hours, serum prolactin increased after metoclopramide in the patients who received levodopa, but not in those who received bromocriptine.[11] Six women who were 2 to 4 days postpartum but were not nursing were given 500 mg of levodopa orally on one day and 100 mg of levodopa plus 35 mg of carbidopa orally on the next day. Both regimens suppressed basal serum prolactin levels. However, levodopa alone caused an 78% decrease in prolactin while the lower dose combination produced only a 51% decrease. The maximal effect occurred about 2 hours after the dose with both regimens.[6] Seven women in the first week postpartum who were breastfeeding about 7 times daily were given levodopa 500 mg orally and their serum prolactin responses was studied. The following day, they started carbidopa 50 mg orally every 6 hours for 2 days. On the third day, they received a single dose of carbidopa 50 mg plus levodopa 125 mg orally. Decreases in basal serum prolactin occurred by 30 minutes after the levodopa and afer 45 minutes with the combination. Decreases were maximum at 120 minutes after the dose and were 62% with levodopa alone and 48% with the combination, although the difference between the 2 regimens was not statistically significant.[12] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited information indicates that maternal doses of methylergonovine up to 0.75 mg daily produce low levels in milk. Product labeling in the U.S. currently recommends avoiding breast feeding for 12 hours following the last dose of methylergonovine. This warning appears to be based on unpublished adverse reactions in breastfed infants after several days of maternal methylergonovine therapy. The use of shorter courses of the drug after delivery during the colostral phase of lactation would not be expected to transfer appreciable amounts of drug to the breastfed infant or risk adverse effects in the infant. Long courses of methylergonovine, especially after the milk comes in, are best avoided in mothers who wish to nurse. When they are required, withholding breast feeding for 12 hours following the last dose of methylergonovine is prudent. If adverse reactions in the breastfed infant  are seen, such as tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhea or agitation, the drug should be discontinued. Some sources recommend avoiding methylergonovine altogether during breastfeeding.[1]<br><br>  Although results of several imperfect studies are somewhat mixed, it appears that methylergonovine can decrease serum prolactin and possibly the amount of milk production and duration of lactation, especially when used in the immediate postpartum period. The effect seems to be related to the dosage and route of administration, with injected doses having a greater impact than oral. A few oral doses may not severely affect lactation."

By 8 hours after the dose, 7 women had undetectable milk levels, although it was 1.2 mcg/L in one individual. The authors estimated that the maximum dosage a breastfed infant would receive after a 7.5 mg daily maternal dosage would be 1.3 mcg which is about 0.3% of the adult dosage.[2] Methylergonovine maleate 0.75 mg daily was administered to postpartum women for 4 days. The exact dosage regimen and number of women were not reported. Two hours after the last dose, milk samples contained 1.3 mcg/L of methylergonovine.[3] Ten women who averaged 4.8 days postpartum received a single oral dose of methylergonovine 250 mcg.

Another case reported to the manufacturer was a breast-fed infant who presented with seizures after about 4 to 6 days of maternal methylergonovine therapy. The infant's seizures began on the second day of treatment of the mother after breastfeeding. Medications were discontinued per the mother. The infantile seizures resolved about six weeks later.[6] It is not possible to determine the causality of any of the adverse effects with the information available. A working group of the French national medication safety agency (ANSM) reported 23 cases of infants exposed to methylergonovine via breastmilk who had a total of 44 adverse reactions.

The working group considered tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhea and agitation to be sufficiently well documented to add to the prescribing information.[7]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Oral methylergonovine in a dose of 0.2 mg 3 times daily for 7 days in 10 postpartum subjects caused no difference in serum prolactin concentrations from placebo administered to 10 postpartum control women. No significant difference found in the daily milk volumes between the groups.[8] A single intramuscular injection of methylergonovine 0.2 mg given to 4 women on day 3 postpartum caused a decrease in serum prolactin beginning 45 to 60 minutes after the dose. For 2 to 3 hours after the dose, serum prolactin levels remained about 50% lower than baseline levels.[9] A single intramuscular injection of methylergonovine 0.2 mg was given to 14 women during the first 1.5 hours postpartum. At 80 to 90 minutes after the injection, the normal postpartum rise in serum prolactin was 56% in the women who received methylergonovine compared to a 285% in serum prolactin in women who received a placebo injection. Six treated women had no increase in serum prolactin compared to 2 of the control women.[10] Thirty women who delivered fullterm infants received a single intramuscular dose of methylergonovine 0.2 mg after delivery, followed by oral ergotamine 1 mg 3 times daily for 6 days. Compared to 28 women who delivered fullterm infants and received no ergot derivatives, there was no difference in the milk production, as measured by weight differences before and after nursing, between the 2 groups during the first 6 days postpartum.[11] Thirty postpartum women were given methylergonovine 0.2 mg orally 3 times daily for the first 7 days postpartum. Baseline (prior to nursing) serum prolactin was no different from those of 30 postpartum women who received no methylergonovine on days 1 and 3 postpartum. However, on day 7 postpartum, serum prolactin levels were significantly less in the treated women. Milk production was also reduced in the treated women on days 3 and 7 postpartum compared to controls.[12] Ten women received a single intravenous dose of 0.4 mg of methylergonovine immediately postpartum were compared to 10 control mothers who received no methylergonovine; all women received a continuous infusion of oxytocin postpartum. None of the women were allowed to nurse or extract milk from their breasts or to receive hormones to suppress lactation. Serum prolactin measured during labor, immediately after administration of the drug and daily at 9 am for 5 days postpartum found no statistical differences in prolactin levels between the 2 groups.[13] In a randomized study, 48 patients were given methylergonovine 0.125 mg orally every 8 hours for the first 7 days postpartum. Another 44 in the same hospital were not given methylergonovine. No statistical differences were found in the serum levels of prolactin at 3 days postpartum between the groups, although women with normal deliveries had higher prolactin levels than those delivered by cesarean section. At 1 month postpartum, no differences were found in the percentage of exclusive breastfeeding or in the weight gain of infants.[14]In a prospective, randomized study, 444 postpartum mothers were given 0.125 mg of methylergonovine 3 times a day, while 436 were given placebo. Milk production among untreated women averaged 880 grams during the first 6 days, while among treated patients it was only 563 grams. After 4 weeks there were still differences in the quantity of milk produced.[15]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Metoclopramide is excreted in variable amounts in breastmilk. Most infants would receive less than 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage, but some receive doses that achieve pharmacologically active serum levels, elevated serum prolactin and possible gastrointestinal side effects. Although most studies have found no adverse effects in breastfed infants during maternal metoclopramide use, many did not adequately observe for side effects.<br><br>  Metoclopramide is used as a galactogogue.[1] Metoclopramide increases serum prolactin, but its clinical value in increasing milk supply is questionable. Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production.[2] In well-designed studies that evaluated the effectiveness of metoclopramide as a galactogogue in women who continue to have difficulty producing milk after nursing techniques have been optimized, it was of no additional benefit. Prophylactic use in the mothers of preterm infants has also shown little or no benefit.<br><br>	  Metoclopramide has no officially established dosage for increasing milk supply. Most studies have used metoclopramide in a dosage of 10 mg 2 or 3 times daily for 7 to 14 days. Some studies used a tapering dosage for the last days few of the regimen to avoid an abrupt drop in milk supply after drug discontinuation. No published literature supports the efficacy or safety of higher dosages, longer treatment periods or repeated courses of therapy.<br><br>Postpartum mothers are at a relatively high risk for postpartum depression and metoclopramide can cause depression as a side effect. Therefore, metoclopramide should probably be avoided in women with a history of major depression and not used for prolonged periods in any mothers during this time of high susceptibility.[3][4] Long-term uses of metoclopramide also increases the risk of tardive dyskinesia.[5] Other reported side effects in nursing mothers include tiredness, nausea, headache, diarrhea, dry mouth, breast discomfort, vertigo, restless legs, intestinal gas, hair loss and anxiety.[4][6][7]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Ten mothers who were 7 to 10 days postpartum were given a single oral dose of metoclopramide 10 mg. Two hours after the dose, the average milk level was 126 mcg/L. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive a maximum daily dosage of 45 mcg/kg.[8] Five mothers took metoclopramide 10 mg orally 3 times daily beginning on day 3 to 9 postpartum because of an insufficient milk supply. Metoclopramide in milk samples taken 1 to 2 hours after a 10 mg dose on days 4 and/or 14 ranged from 52 to 157 mcg/L. The authors estimated that these infants would receive maximum metoclopramide dosages of 6 to 24 mcg/kg daily. The same paper reported on 18 women who received metoclopramide 10 mg orally 3 times daily beginning in week 8 to 12 postpartum. Milk levels measured once on the morning of day 9 to 11 of therapy averaged 48 mcg/L (range 21 to 125 mcg/L). The authors estimated that these infants would receive maximum metoclopramide dosages averaging 5.2 mcg/kg (range 0.8 to 13.2 mcg/kg) daily.[9] This latter group of infants would receive about 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Seventeen women who were part of a study of metoclopramide for enhancing lactation in mothers of premature infants had complete 24-hour milk samples measured for metoclopramide. The dosage was 10 mg orally 3 times daily and milk samples were collected between day 6 and 14 of therapy. Three of the mothers had no measurable metoclopramide in milk. The other 14 mothers had metoclopramide milk levels averaging 45 mcg/L. The authors calculated that a fully breastfed infant would receive 11 mcg/kg daily.[10][11] This corresponds to about 2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and 7 to 11% of a dose for preterm infants.[12] Infant Levels: Five breastfed infants were studied whose mothers were taking metoclopramide 10 mg orally 3 times daily beginning on the day 3 to 9 postpartum because of an insufficient milk supply. Serum metoclopramide levels were undetectable (  < 2 mcg/L) in 4 infants; the fifth had serum levels of 20.9 and 18.6 mcg/L on days 4 and 14 postpartum, respectively. These levels averaged 8% of the infant's mother's metoclopramide serum levels which were very high.[9] A study of neonates who each received a single oral dose of 100 to 150 mcg/kg found peak serum levels averaging 17.7 mcg/L,[12] which is similar to the levels achieved in the breastfed infant with metoclopramide detectable in serum."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In an early report, 5 infants were nursed during 7 to 10 days of maternal metoclopramide therapy at a dosage of 10 mg orally 3 times daily. No adverse effects were noted.[13] In a placebo-controlled study of the effect of metoclopramide on milk production in 37 women, an infant whose mother was taking oral metoclopramide 15 mg 3 times daily reportedly had intestinal discomfort. No infants whose mothers were taking a dosage of 5 or 10 mg 3 times daily or placebo had any adverse effects. Metoclopramide was possibly the cause of the adverse reaction.[6] Seventeen mothers with poor lactation were treated with oral metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily for 3 weeks. One mother reported that she and her infant had increased intestinal gas formation during treatment. Metoclopramide was possibly the cause of the adverse reaction.[7] Thirty-two mothers with complete or partial lactation failure were given oral metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily for 10 days and advised to nurse every 3 hours. None of the mothers reported adverse effects in their infants.[14] Twenty-three premature infants whose mothers were having difficulty maintaining milk production had steady weight gain and no adverse effects related to feeding tolerance or stool frequency during maternal metoclopramide therapy. The mothers were taking oral metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily for 7 days, with a tapering dosage for 2 more days, beginning at an average of 32 days postpartum.[15] Thirteen women with insufficient milk production who were 4 to 20 weeks postpartum were randomized to receive metoclopramide or placebo 10 mg orally 3 times daily. The average plasma prolactin levels before therapy and afer 3 weeks of maternal therapy were no different in the infants of women who received metoclopramide or placebo.[16] Eleven breastfed infants whose mothers were given oral metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily for 5 days beginning on day 1 postpartum were compared to the infants of 11 matched mothers who received no metoclopramide. No difference in average serum prolactin was found between the groups, indicating little transfer of the drug to the infants via breastmilk.[17] Five breastfed infants were studied whose mothers were taking metoclopramide 10 mg orally 3 times daily beginning on the day 3 to 9 postpartum because of an insufficient milk supply. Before therapy, their plasma prolactin levels were similar to their mothers'. On day 4 of maternal therapy, 3 of the infants had plasma prolactin levels higher than the highest levels of control infants of the same age, and on day 14, one infant had a plasma prolactin level higher than the highest levels of control infants of the same age. Plasma levels in 3 other infants were in the normal range during therapy.[9]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Metoclopramide increases serum prolactin in lactating and nonlactating women.[18][19] This effect is thought to be caused by the drug's antidopaminergic effect. Galactorrhea has been reported after long-term use of metoclopramide for nausea associated with migraine. The patient was taking 10 to 40 mg 1 to 4 times weekly for about 4 months.[20] Numerous papers have reported studies that used metoclopramide to increase milk production. All studies were small with 40 or fewer patients. Most of the studies have designs that would not be considered valid using today's standards of evidence-based medicine. Many of the studies had no placebo control;[7][9][14][15][17][21][22][23] only 7 studies employed randomization;[6][8][11][16][24][25][26] and only 2 of the studies were clearly and adequately blinded.[11][24] Among all of the published studies, only 5 meet or come close to meeting current evidence-based medicine standards. These studies are described in more detail below. In one early double-blind study, 20 women who had undergone delivery by emergency or elective cesarean section were randomized to take oral metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily (n=10) or placebo for 7 days (n=10) beginning on the first day after cesarean section.[8] All mothers expressed a desire to breastfeed their infants for at least 3 months and received daily visits by an investigator to discuss breastfeeding problems and were given advice and encouragement to breastfeed. The mothers in the 2 groups were closely matched except that 3 preterm infants in the metoclopramide group were separated from their mothers in the intensive care unit and were nursed there initially and fed expressed milk until discharge. At 10 days postpartum, there were no differences in the number of infants being breastfed in each group; at 6 weeks postpartum, 9 women were breastfeeding in the metoclopramide group and 8 in the placebo group; and 3 months postpartum 4 were breastfeeding in each group. Although this was a small study, it was well designed and executed. It provided preliminary evidence of the benefit of patient counseling and encouragement on breastfeeding success. Thirteen primiparous nursing mothers without breastfeeding difficulties and normal infants were given either oral metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily (n=7) or placebo (n=6) for 8 days beginning on the first day postpartum in a randomized, double-blind study.[24] No attempt was made to improve nursing technique, but mothers nursed on a 3-hour schedule beginning at 6:30 am on the day following delivery. No mention was made of the type of feeding, or the number of feedings that the infants received between birth and the initiation of breastfeeding or any differences in the two groups of infants in this regard. All women completed the trial. No differences were found in serum prolactin of treated and control women throughout 28 days of observation. Milk intake as measured by infant weight change before and after the second daily feeding on days 3 through 8 was greater by an average of 24.3 mL (51.1 mL vs 75.4 mL) in the infants of treated mothers; however, statistically significant differences in milk production did not occur until day 5 postpartum. This paper has several serious flaws related to its analysis. A recent study showed that weighing infants is not an accurate method of estimating milk intake.[27] This problem is magnified by the fact that the paper does not state the number of feedings per day, so the fraction of the infant's daily feedings that this one feeding represented is unknown. The study also failed to report serial infant weight gain during the study period. These serious problems invalidate the study results.Fifty mothers who had complete or partial lactation failure received extensive instruction on how to increase their milk supply.[25] Their infants were hospitalized for various illnesses and ranged from 29 to 100 day of age. Maternal lactation history was comparable in the two groups. Mothers were randomized either to receive or not receive metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily for 10 days. Although no specific metoclopramide placebo was given to control mothers, all mothers received multivitamins, iron, and folic acid daily which the authors used to obscure to the mother whether she was receiving an active drug or not. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups in the time to initiation of milk secretion, to partial restoration of breastfeeding, or to complete breastfeeding or in the weight gain of the infants during the study period of 96 days. The authors concluded that successful relactation can be accomplished without galactogogues such as metoclopramide. This study lacked a true placebo control; however, it employed excellent breastfeeding instruction and infant evaluation techniques and had the best overall design of any of the studies on mothers who had older infants and well documented insufficient milk supplies at the start of the study. In a well-controlled and analyzed, randomized, double-blinded study of the mothers of premature (23 to 34 weeks) infants, mothers received either metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily (n=31) or placebo (n=29) for 10 days beginning within 96 hours of delivery.[11] The groups were well matched and all mothers received standardized instructions from a lactation consultant and provided access to breastfeeding support. No selection was made for mothers who were having difficulties producing milk. Six subjects each in the drug and placebo groups dropped out for a relatively high dropout rate of 17.4%. Although by far the best designed and executed study to date on any galactogogue, the study enrolled all mothers of preterm infants without any evaluation of their ability to produce milk. This population may in general need lactation support, but the possible inclusion of women in both the active drug and placebo groups who would have had little difficulty in milk production may have minimized differences between the groups. A study of 20 primiparous mothers whose infant were not gaining weight adequately compared metoclopramide (n = 10) to placebo (n = 10) for increasing milk supply. All mothers passed a brief training course on improving breastfeeding technique and the benefits of breastfeeding before entering the study. All infants gained weight over the next 2 weeks. The increase in weight in the metoclopramide group was not different from the placebo group.[26] Two women whose infants were born via a surrogate pregnancy other women were given metoclopramide beginning at 28 weeks of the pregnancy. One woman stopped metoclopramide 1 week prior to the expected delivery date and the other continued meoclopramide postpartum. They also underwent postpartum nipple stimulation with an electric breast pump. Lactation was established and they were each able to partially breastfeed their infants for 3 months.[28][29] A double-blind randomized study compared the effect on milk production of metoclopramide 10 mg to placebo 3 times daily for 10 days in the mothers of preterm infants born at 28 to 34 weeks of gestation. At the beginning of investigation, all participating women were taught a standard breastfeeding method. Mothers used a breast pump for 10 to 15 minutes every 2 hours and the volume of milk was measured and recorded at each pumping for 10 days. No difference in daily milk volumes between the two groups occurred until day 7 postpartum, when treated mothers pumped an average of 373 mL compared with 352 mL in the mothers receiving placebo. This difference of about 20 mL per day persisted until the end of the study on day 10 when the treated group pumped 446 mL and the placebo group pumped 422 mL.[30] The clinical importance of the extra 20 mL of milk per day is questionable. A randomized, double-blind study of 26 mothers who delivered at 34 weeks of gestation or less, compared metoclopramide 10 mg 3 times daily to placebo. The drug or placebo was taken for 8 days beginning within 36 hours of delivery. All women were provided breast pumps and support from a lactation consultant. The total volume of milk pumped per day was recorded by the women, 19 of whom completed the entire protocol. Although milk production increased over the 8-day period, metoclopramide was no better than placebo and the standard care provided. No difference in reported side effects was found.[31] Mothers who were expressing milk for their infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (mean gestational age 28 weeks) were given instructions on methods for increasing milk supply. If they were producing less than 160 mL of milk per kg of infant weight daily after several days, mothers were randomized to receive either domperidone or metoclopramide 10 mg by mouth 3 times daily for 10 days in a double-blinded fashion. Thirty-one mothers who received domperidone and 34 who received metoclopramide provided data on daily milk volumes during the 10 days. Milk volumes increased over the 10-day period by 96% with domperidone and 94% with metoclopramide, which was not statistically different between the groups. Some mothers continued to measure milk output after the end of the medication period. Results were similar between the 2 groups. Side effects in the domperidone group (3 women) included headache, diarrhea, mood swings and dizziness. Side effects in the metoclopramide group (7 women) included headache (3 women), diarrhea, mood swings, changed appetite, dry mouth and discomfort in the breasts. Of 29 women who took metoclopramide after the trial ended, 8 reported side effects including diarrhea, mood swings, depression (2 women), itchy skin, tiredness, restless legs and less effective milk stimulation.[4] The lack of a placebo group and the projection of milk volumes to impute missing data from some mothers detract from the findings of this study."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "The use of povidone-iodine in the mother near term and during breastfeeding increases breastmilk iodine levels and can cause transient hypothyroidism in breastfed infants, especially in geographic areas that are iodine deficient. Maternal exposure to povidone-iodine near term can sometimes interfere with thyroid studies done as a part of newborn screening tests. Although povidone-iodine is minimally absorbed through intact adult skin, exposure of mothers who are or will be breastfeeding to povidone-iodine should be minimized by using lower concentrations of povidone-iodine, applying it to the smallest possible surface areas of the body, shortening contact time, and avoiding repeated applications. Iodine absorption can be extensive with vaginal use; avoid douching with povidone iodine or use of iodine-containing tampons during breastfeeding."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Random samples of breastmilk from day 5 postpartum in 140 women were analyzed for iodine content. Iodine levels in milk samples were 0.095 mg/L in mothers not exposed to any iodine (n = 91). In women who had 10% povidone iodine (10 mg/mL of iodine) topically applied, iodine levels were about 0.14 mg/L in women who had it applied once to 900 square cm of skin for epidural analgesia (n = 39), and about 1.2 mg/L in women who it applied to the entire abdominal wall 3 times before cesarean section (n = 10).[1] Iodine milk levels were measured in a study of mothers who received 10% povidone-iodine (n = 21) or chlorhexidine (n = 13) topically to the perineum starting immediately before the final stage of labor and daily postpartum to the episiotomy. At 96 hours postpartum, milk iodine levels averaged 1.2 mg/L in mothers who received topical povidone-iodine compared to average milk levels of 0.1 mg/L in the mothers who received chlorhexidine.[2] A study randomized 80 consecutive term patients into 4 groups who received either povidone-iodine or benzalkonium chloride as a skin disinfectant before delivery and one of these for postpartum vaginal lacerations. Prepartum doses were about 7 mL and postpartum doses were about 0.5 mL. The calculated amount of iodine ingested by the infants in breastmilk during the first 5 days of life correlated well with the amount of povidone-iodine applied to their mothers' skin. Patients who received prepartum povidone-iodine had higher median breastmilk iodide levels on day 5 postpartum than those not exposed (0.93 mg/L pre- and postpatrum, 0.76 mg/L prepartum only); those with only postpartum povidone-iodine did not have elevated iodine milk levels (0.62 to 0.64 mg/L).[3] A nursing mother who was 7.5 months postpartum used povidone-iodine gel containing 50 mg of iodine per 5 gram dose vaginally once daily for 6 days. Three days after discontinuing the gel, total milk iodine levels were 0.55 mg/L which was 3 to 4 times the typical milk iodine levels and over 6 times her serum iodine level. Total iodine levels fell to 0.1 mg/L by day 7 and and inexplicably increased to 0.23 mg/L on day 8 after stopping.[4] A woman began vaginal douching twice daily with povidone-iodine after delivery. On day 22 postpartum, her breastmilk iodine levels were extremely elevated at 5 micromoles/L. After discontinuing douching, her breastmilk iodine levels dropped to normal levels of less than 1 micromole/L by 7 days after discontinuing povidone-iodine douching.[5] Infant Levels: The mother of a 7.5 month-old breastfed (extent not stated) infant used povidone-iodine gel containing 50 mg per 5 gram dose vaginally once daily for 6 days. Two days later, she noted the odor of iodine on her infant. The infant's serum and urinary iodine levels were extremely elevated, with a serum total iodine level of 0.13 mg/L and a urinary level of 1.02 mg/L or 6.8 mg/gram of creatinine. Serum thyroxine and thyrotropin (TSH) were normal.[4] A woman began using povidone-iodine as a vaginal douche twice daily after delivery. Her breastfed infant developed hypothyroidism accompanied by high urine iodine levels of about 4 micromoles/L. The infant's urine iodine levels were about 0.3 micromoles/L by 2 weeks after the mother discontinued douching.[5] In a study of mothers who received 10% povidone-iodine (n = 21) or chlorhexidine (n = 13) topically to the perineum starting immediately before the final stage of labor and daily postpartum to the episiotomy, urine iodine levels were measured in their infants. In the infants whose mothers received povidone-iodine, urine iodine levels were much higher at 24 and 48 hours postpartum. At 96 hours postpartum, the breastfed infants (n = 13) infants whose mothers received povidone-iodine had urine iodine levels of 8.3 mg/L compared to levels of 0.4 mg/L in those who did not breastfeed (n = 8) and 0.6 mg/L in the infants of mothers who received chlorhexidine (n = 13).[2]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In a study in Belgium, breastfed infants had urinary iodine levels and thyroid function tests measured at 5 days of age. Infants whose mothers were not exposed to any iodine (n = 23) had urinary iodine levels of 0.144 mg/L, those whose mothers had 10% povidone-iodine applied to 900 square cm before epidural analgesia (n = 27) had urinary iodine levels of about 0.28 mg/L, and those whose mothers had 10% povidone iodine applied 3 times to their entire abdomen (n = 11) had urinary iodine levels of 1.84 mg/L. Both basal and thyrotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated thyrotropin (TSH) levels were higher in infants exposed to the breastmilk from mothers who received topical povidone-iodine. Serum thyroxine (T4) and liothyroinine (T3) levels were normal in all groups.[1] A woman began bathing almost daily with povidone-iodine (1% iodine) and applying povidone-iodine 1% ointment to her skin daily during pregnancy and for 6 weeks postpartum for furunculosis. At 6 weeks of age, her breastfed (extent not stated) infant had a low serum thyroxine level of 4 ng/L (normal 7 to 20 ng/L), a greatly elevated serum thyrotropin level of 99 units/L (normal 0.8 to 5 units/L). The infant was treated with oral levothyroxine until the age of 7 months at which time thyroid function tests and development were normal.[6]A woman began using povidone-iodine as a vaginal douche twice daily after delivery. Her breastfed infant developed hypothyroidism (low serum thyroxine and high thyrotropin) over the first 3 weeks of life. After oral levothyroxine supplementation of the infant was begun and maternal povidone-iodine was discontinued, the infant's thyroid function tests normalized within a week.[5] A group of investigators in Belgium reviewed the results of infant thyrotropin levels on day 5 postpartum in 4745 newborn infants delivered over a 2-year period at their hospital. Infants were divided among those whose mothers had iodine overload (n = 3086) from topical povidone-iodine 10% solution during labor and delivery and those whose mothers had no iodine overload (n = 1659). Mothers had povidone-iodine applied either as a single application to 900 square cm for epidural anesthesia or 3 applications to the entire abdominal wall for cesarean section. Breastfed infants whose mothers had iodine overload had a greater risk for having elevated thyrotropin levels and requiring recall for retesting (3.2% with cesarean section and 2.7% with epidural anesthesia) compared to those who did not (0.1%). Bottle-fed infants were affected much less than breastfed infants.[7] After replacing povidone-iodine with chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70% isopropanol for disinfection for 6 months, 1178 infants that were delivered at this institution had no increased rate of elevations in thyroid function tests and a reduced rate of recalls in breastfed infants.[8] In a study of mothers in Spain who received 10% povidone-iodine (n = 21) or chlorhexidine (n = 13) topically to the perineum starting immediately before the final stage of labor and daily postpartum to the episiotomy, no differences in thyrotropin, thyroxine or free thyroxine was found among their breastfed infants at day 5 to 7 postpartum.[2]A breastfed infant whose mother was using povidone-iodine as a douche during pregnancy and during the first few weeks after delivery had symptoms of sinus tachycardia and increased concentrations of blood total and free thyroxine at 10 days of age and elevated thyrotropin at 1 month of age. The povidone-iodine was discontinued and the infant's total thyroxine normalized by 1 month of age, free thyroxine normalized by 1.5 months of age and the thyrotropin level normalized by 2.5 months of age. No other explanation for the thyroid function abnormalities could be found except maternal povidone-iodine use, but blood and milk iodine levels were not measured. Povidone-iodine was the probable cause of the adverse reaction in the infant.[9] A study in Japan randomized 80 consecutive term patients into 4 groups who received either povidone-iodine or benzalkonium chloride as a skin disinfectant before delivery and one of these for postpartum vaginal lacerations. Prepartum doses were about 7 mL and postpartum doses were about 0.5 mL of solution. Infant thyrotropin levels were elevated in the infants whose mothers received topical povidone-iodine pre- and postpartum compared to infants whose mothers received no povidone-iodine. After discontinuing the use of peripartum povidone-iodine, the rate of recall of infants for abnormal thyroid function tests dropped from 4.47% to 0.74%.[3] In Switzerland, a girl born at 29 weeks of gestation with adequate size for gestational age showed negative TSH screening on day 5. Her mother had developed an abscess of the abdominal wall 1 week after her cesarian section and was treated with povidone-iodine tampons. The baby's TSH was elevated to 23 milliunits/L on day 23, and 288 milliunits/L on day 29. Free thyroxine (T4) levels were decreased to 2.8 ng/L and free liothyronine (T3) with 1.52 ng/L, without signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism. Iodine contents of maternal milk and of infant urine were 4.4 mg/L and 3.9 mg/L, respectively. Treatment with levothyroxine was started, breastfeeding was discontinued and disinfection with povidone-iodine was stopped. The infant's thyroid function tests normalized after 6 days.[10] The infant's abnormal thyroid function tests were probably caused by maternal iodine use."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Release from the progesterone-releasing intrauterine device available in the United States is 65 mcg/day or only 0.65% of the dose released from most of the devices reported in the literature. Because of the low levels of progesterone in breastmilk, even with the high-dose products, amounts ingested by the infant are small and would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. The progesterone vaginal ring available in some countries produces maternal blood levels that are lower than those of ovulating women.[1] Most studies indicate that progesterone is not detrimental to milk production or duration of nursing.[2] No special precautions appear to be required."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Women who received 6 subdermal implants containing 100 mg each of progesterone between days 30 to 35 postpartum for contraception had milk progesterone levels measured. Milk progesterone levels were 5.7 mcg/L in 6 women at 3 to 4 months postpartum and 6.3 mcg/L in 7 women at 9 to 12 months postpartum. By comparison, 9 women who received a Copper T intrauterine device had negligible progesterone levels. The authors estimated that infants would receive about 5 mcg of progesterone daily through breastmilk.[3][4] Infant Levels: Women received 6 subdermal implants containing 100 mg each of progesterone between days 30 to 35 postpartum for contraception. A metabolite of progesterone, pregnane-3-glucuronide, was measured in the urine of their infants. At 3 to 4 months (n = 9) and 9 to 12 months (n = 7) postpartum, urine metabolite levels were 6.3 mcg/L and 15.7 mcg/L, respectively. These values were not significantly different from those of infants whose mothers were using a Copper T intrauterine device.[3][4]"

Compared to women who received either a placebo or a Copper T intrauterine device, there were no differences in the growth rates of their infants over the first 6 months postpartum.[5] One hundred ninety-two mothers who received 6 subdermal implants containing 100 mg each of progesterone inserted on postpartum day 60 as a contraceptive. The weight gain of 60 infants who were exclusively breastfed for 6 months was compared to that of infants whose mothers received either placebo (n = 68 at day 30) or a Copper T (n = 64 at day 30 and n = 49 at day 60) intrauterine device. No differences were found in the average weight gains among the 3 groups of infants at 6 months of age.[6]Vaginal rings that released progesterone were inserted at about 60 days postpartum in 128 women. The 2 types of rings released progesterone either 7.5 mg daily decreasing to 4.5 mg at 90 days or 15 mg daily decreasing to 7 mg daily at 90 days. Over the first 12 months postpartum, no differences in weight gain were found between the exclusively breastfed infants of mothers who received the progesterone rings and control mothers who received a Copper T intrauterine device for contraception.[7] One hundred twenty breastfeeding women used a vaginal ring that released about 10 mg daily of progesterone for 90 days, starting during weeks 5 to 7 postpartum. No differences were found in the growth of breastfed infants or in developmental milestones compared to the normal population values.[8] One hundred eighty-seven breastfeeding women used a vaginal ring that released about 10 mg daily of progesterone, starting at about day 57 postpartum. No differences were found in weight gain during the first 6 months of use compared to infants whose mothers received either a Copper T intrauterine device, an oral progestin-only contraceptive or levonorgestrel implant.[9] A study comparing 100 women who received vaginal ring that released about 10 mg daily of progesterone to those who received a Copper T intrauterine device between days 29 and 64 postpartum found no differences in weight gain of their breastfed infants over the first year postpartum.[10] Two hundred eighty-five women who received a vaginal ring that released about 10 mg daily of progesterone were compared to 262 women who received a Copper T intrauterine device beginning between weeks 5 and 9 postpartum. No differences in the weight gain of breastfed infants were seen between the 2 groups during the 14-month observation period.[11]"

The 3 types of rings released progesterone either 5, 10 or 15 mg daily. Control women received a Copper T intrauterine device. At 6 and 12 months postpartum there was no significant difference in the percentage of infants who were breastfed between the progesterone and Copper T groups.[12] One hundred twenty breastfeeding women used a vaginal ring that released about 10 mg daily of progesterone, starting during weeks 5 to 7 postpartum. The rate of weaning was greater in the progesterone ring group than in groups of women who received levonorgestrel or norethindrone implants for postpartum contraception.[8]In a multicenter study, 802 women who received a vaginal ring that released about 10 mg daily of progesterone were compared to 734 women who received a Copper T intrauterine device beginning at day 29 to 63 postpartum.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Domperidone is not approved for marketing in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration, but is available in Canada and other countries. Domperidone may also be available from some compounding pharmacies in the US. The quality of such products cannot be assured, and the FDA has warned against their use.[1]<br><br>  Data available from 4 small studies on the excretion of domperidone into breastmilk are somewhat inconsistent, but infants would probably receive less than 0.1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. No adverse effects have been found in a limited number of published cases of breastfed infants whose mothers were taking domperidone.<br><br>  Domperidone is sometimes used as a galactogogue to increase milk supply.[2] Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production.[3] Most mothers who are provided instruction in good breastfeeding technique and breastfeed frequently are unlikely to obtain additional benefit from domperidone. Whether domperidone has any benefit as a galactogogue in women who continue to have insufficient milk production after nursing technique and frequency have been optimized has not been adequately studied. A meta-analysis of 3 studies that compared domperidone to placebo or no treatment concluded that domperidone increased milk production.[4] However, another meta-analysis of the 2 studies of domperidone in the aforementioned meta-analysis that met strict inclusion criteria for treatment of demonstrated lactation insufficiency in mothers of preterm infants at more than 2 weeks postpartum found that although domperidone increased milk supply acutely, it might not improve long-term outcomes of breastfeeding in this population.[5] Other reviewers concluded that improvement of breastfeeding practices seems more effective and safer than off-label use of  domperidone.[6][7]<br><br>  Domperidone has no officially established dosage for increasing milk supply. Most published studies have used domperidone in a dosage of 10 mg 3 times daily for 4 to 10 days. Two small studies found no statistically significant additional increase in milk output with a dosage of 20 mg 3 times daily compared to a dosage of 10 mg 3 times daily[8][9] and that women who failed to respond to the low dosage did not respond to the higher dosage.[8] Dosages greater than 30 mg daily may increase the  risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients receiving domperidone,[10] although some feel that the risk is less in nursing mothers because of their relatively younger age.[11] Nevertheless, mothers should be advised to stop taking domperidone and seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs or symptoms of an abnormal heart rate or rhythm while taking domperidone, including dizziness, palpitations, syncope or seizures.[10] Maternal side effects of domperidone reported in galactogogue studies include  dry mouth, headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. Some of these were more frequent with 60 mg daily than with 30 mg daily.[8][9][12][13] Drug withdrawal symptoms consisting of insomnia, anxiety, and tachycardia were reported in a woman taking 80 mg of domperidone daily for 8 months as a galactogogue who abruptly tapered the dose over 3 days.[14] Another mother took domperidone 10 mg three times daily for 10 months as a galactagogue and stopped abruptly. After discontinuation, she experienced severe insomnia, severe anxiety, severe cognitive problems and depression.[15]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Thirty breastmilk samples were obtained from 6 mothers taking domperidone 10 mg 3 times daily and 28 milk samples were obtained from 5 mothers taking domperidone 20 mg 3 times daily.

The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive daily dosages of 0.04 and 0.07 mcg/kg daily, respectively, at these maternal dosages. The estimated weight-adjusted maternal dosages were 0.012% and 0.009%, respectively.[8] A double-blind, controlled trial compared two dosages of domperidone for increasing milk supply in mothers of preterm infants. Mothers received either 10 mg or 20 mg three times daily. Drug concentrations in breastmilk were measured once between days 10 and 15 three hours after a dose. Milk domperidone concentrations were 3.4 mcg/L with the 10 mg dose (n = 4) and 6.9 mcg/L with the 20 mg dose (n = 3).[9] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

No side effects were reported in any of the breastfed (extent not stated) infants.[16][17] Eleven women took domperidone 10 mg 3 times daily for 7 days to increase the supply of pumped milk for their preterm neonates. No side effects were reported in their infants.[18]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Domperidone increases serum prolactin in lactating and nonlactating women.[8][19][20][21] This effect is thought to be caused by the drug's antidopaminergic effect. In nonpregnant women, domperidone is less effective than the same dose of oral metoclopramide in raising serum prolactin; however, in multiparous women their effects are similar.[19][21] Domperidone has caused galactorrhea in nonpregnant women[22][23][24][25][26] and in one male infant.[27] One study, which was published twice in 2 different journals,[16][17] reported two separate small studies. In the first study, 15 women with a history of defective lactogenesis were given either oral domperidone 10 mg (n = 8) or placebo (n = 7) 3 times daily from day 2 to 5 postpartum. The patients were apparently not randomized and blinding was not mentioned in the paper. No instruction or support in breastfeeding technique was provided. The groups had similar serum prolactin levels at the start of the study. Baseline serum prolactin levels were higher in the treated women from day 3 to 5 postpartum. Suckling-induced serum prolactin increases were higher in the treated women than in the placebo group from day 2 postpartum onward. Milk yield was calculated by weighing the infants before and after each nursing for 24 hours. Increase in milk yield were greater in the treated mothers from day 2 onward; however, the lower average milk yield in the placebo group was due to 3 women with very low milk output. Average infant weight gain was correspondingly greater in the treated group. At 1 month postpartum, all treated mothers were nursing well, but 5 of 7 untreated mothers had inadequate (not defined) lactation. No correlation was found between baseline serum prolactin or the increase in prolactin and milk production.In the same paper(s), 17 primiparous women who had insufficient lactation (30% below normal) at 2 weeks postpartum were studied using the same methodology as above. Mothers were given either oral domperidone 10 mg (n = 9) or placebo (n = 8) 3 times daily for 10 days. The groups did not have significantly different serum prolactin levels at the start of the study. Serum prolactin levels were higher in the treated than untreated women from day 2 onward and milk production was higher in the treated group from day 4 onward. At the end of the study no untreated woman had an increase in milk supply from day 1. One month after the beginning of the study, all treated women had adequate milk production. No correlation was found between serum prolactin and milk production.[16] One well-designed, but small trial was reported with domperidone. Twenty women who were pumping milk with a good quality electric pump for their preterm infants were given either oral domperidone 10 mg (n = 11) or placebo (n = 9) 3 times daily for 7 days in a randomized, double-blind, trial. The mothers averaged 32 to 33 days postpartum. All had failed to produce sufficient milk for their infant after extensive counseling by lactation consultants. By day 5 of therapy, the serum prolactin levels of the treated mothers had increased by 119 mcg/L in the treated group compared to 18 mcg/L in the placebo group. Serum prolactin decreased to baseline levels in both groups 3 days after discontinuation of the study medications. Although the (partially imputed) baseline milk production was greater in the domperidone group (113 mL daily) than in the placebo group (48 mL daily), the average daily increases in milk production on days 2 to 7 were 45% (to 184 mL) and 17% (to 66 mL) in the domperidone and placebo groups, respectively. However, 4 women in the domperidone group failed to complete the study and only the study completers were matched and found to be similar at baseline. No follow-up beyond the 7-day study period was done to evaluate the persistence of an effect of domperidone on lactation success.[18] While this study appears to offer evidence of a beneficial effect on the milk supply in the mothers of preterm infants who are pumping their milk, several factors make this conclusion questionable: a 36% drop-out rate in the active drug group, the lack of an intent-to-treat analysis, and the vast difference in baseline milk supply between the domperidone and placebo groups. Twenty-five women who had been given domperidone 20 mg 4 times daily to increase milk supply had their dosages decreased over 2 to 4 weeks and discontinued. The duration of domperidone use was not stated in the abstract. All women had stable milk output and were nursing infants under 3 months of age who were growing normally. Of the 25 women, 23 did not increase their use of formula and all infants grew normally, indicating that domperidone can be withdrawn without a detrimental effect on infant nutrition.[28] Six women who were unable to produce sufficient milk for their preterm infants after counseling by lactation consultants were given domperidone in dosages of 10 mg 3 times daily or 20 mg 3 times daily in a crossover fashion. Baseline serum prolactin concentrations were increased by both dosages to a similar extent. Milk production increased in only 4 of the 6 women. In the other 4 women, milk production increased from 8.7 g/hour at baseline to 23.6 g/hour with 30 mg daily and 29.4 g/hour with 60 mg daily, although there was no statistically significant difference in between the 2 dosages. Side effects in the mothers of dry mouth, abdominal cramping and headache were more frequent with the higher dosage. Severe abdominal cramping caused one mother to drop out of the study during the run-in phase. Additionally, constipation and depressed mood were reported at the higher dosage.[8]Mothers of preterm infants (  < 31 weeks) with insufficient milk supply were given either domperidone 10 mg orally 3 times daily or placebo in a randomized, double-blind study. Women who received domperidone had a greater increase in milk volume (+267%) than in the placebo group (19%) at the end of 14 days. Breastmilk calcium concentration increased in the domperidone group (+62%) and decreased (-4%) in the placebo group. Carbohydrate concentrations increased slightly in the mothers receiving domperidone (+2.7%) and decreased slightly (-2.7%) in those receiving placebo. No statistical differences were found in protein, energy, fat, sodium or phosphate concentrations between the groups.[29] A retrospective, uncontrolled case series reported 14 mothers of preterm infants in the intensive care unit who had been given domperidone 20 mg three times daily to increase their milk supply. The pumped volume of milk increased by 48% over 14 days. However, the lack of a control group renders this report uninterpretable.[30] Mothers who underwent cesarean section at term were randomized to receive either oral domperidone 10 mg (n = 22) or placebo (n = 23) 4 times daily in a double-blind fashion beginning within the 24 hours postpartum. Nurses collected the mothers' milk with an electric breast pump applied for 15 minutes twice daily 2 hours after the mothers nursed their infants. The volume of milk collected by this incomplete collection technique was greater at all times, including at baseline, in the domperidone group. Seven women in the domperidone group reported dry mouth, and none in the placebo group.[12] Because of the endpoint selected and inequalities at baseline, it is impossible to attribute any clinical relevance to these results. Mothers who were expressing milk for their infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (mean gestational age 28 weeks) were given instructions on methods for increasing milk supply. If they were producing less than 160 mL of milk per kg of infant weight daily after several days, mothers were randomized to receive either domperidone or metoclopramide 10 mg by mouth 3 times daily for 10 days in a double-blinded fashion. Thirty-one mothers who received domperidone and 34 who received metoclopramide provided data on daily milk volumes during the 10 days. Milk volumes increased over the 10-day period by 96% with domperidone and 94% with metoclopramide, which was not statistically different between the groups. Some mothers continued to measure milk output after the end of the medication period. Results were similar between the 2 groups. Side effects in the domperidone group (3 women) included headache, diarrhea, mood swings and dizziness. Side effects in the metoclopramide group (7 women) included headache (3 women), diarrhea, mood swings, changed appetite, dry mouth and discomfort in the breasts.[13] The lack of a placebo group and the projection of milk volumes to impute missing data from some mothers detract from the findings of this study.A double-blind, controlled trial compared two dosages of domperidone for increasing milk supply in mothers of preterm infants. Mothers received either 10 mg (n = 8) or 20 mg (n = 7) three times daily for 4 weeks, followed by a tapering dosage over the subsequent 2 weeks. Both dosages increased milk volume, but there was no statistically significant different in milk volumes between the two groups.[9] A randomized trial in Pakistan compared the effects of domperidone 10 mg to placebo 3 times daily in women who delivered at term and had 10 mL or less of milk production from both breasts per single expression on day 6 postpartum. All women were given some counseling about proper breastfeeding technique. After 7 days of drug or placebo use, women were categorized as having either 50 mL or greater milk production per single expression or less than 50 mL. Serum prolactin was not measured. Seventy-two percent of women given domperidone successfully increased their milk supply compared to 11% in the placebo group. Problems with the study included an apparent lack of blinding of the drugs, investigators and mothers as well as the questionable endpoint of a single expression at an uncontrolled time of day rather than a daily total of milk output.[31]"

Mothers had povidone-iodine applied either as a single application to 900 square cm for epidural anesthesia or 3 applications to the entire abdominal wall for cesarean section. Breastfed infants whose mothers had iodine overload had a greater risk for having elevated thyrotropin levels and requiring recall for retesting (3.2% with cesarean section and 2.7% with epidural anesthesia) compared to those who did not (0.1%). Bottle-fed infants were affected much less than breastfed infants.[2] After replacing povidone-iodine with chlorhexidine 0.5% in 70% isopropanol for disinfection for 6 months, 1178 infants that were delivered at this institution had no increased rate of elevations in thyroid function tests and a reduced rate of recalls in breastfed infants.[3] In a study of mothers in Spain who received 10% povidone-iodine (n = 21) or chlorhexidine (n = 13) topically to the perineum starting immediately before the final stage of labor and daily postpartum to the episiotomy, no differences in thyrotropin, thyroxine or free thyroxine was found among their breastfed infants at day 5 to 7 postpartum.[1] Studies in Africa have used chlorhexidine vaginally prior to delivery in an attempt to reduce the frequency of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. In one, cotton soaked in 0.25% chlorhexidine solution was used to swab the vaginal walls every 4 hours from admission into labor until delivery in 4078 women.[4] The other study used 120 mL of either 0.2% or 0.4% chlorhexidine solution as a vaginal lavage every 3 hours from admission to labor until delivery in 309 women. The average number of lavages was 2.1 (range 1 to 11).[5] Chlorhexidine 0.25% swabs reduced MTCT in patients whose membranes ruptured more than 4 hours before delivery, but not in other women. Vaginal lavage showed a statistically nonsignificant trend towards reduction of MTCT, with the 0.4% greater than the 0.2%. Almost all of the infants in these studies were breastfed. No adverse events were reported in the infants, but follow-up related primarily to infant mortality and HIV status rather than effects of chlorhexidine."

Discomfort and nipple trauma were less frequent in the chlorhexidine group than in the placebo group, particularly at the first assessment. Although skin flora on the breasts of the treated mothers was reduced, there was no difference in the frequency of mastitis between the treated and placebo groups. No obvious side effects occurred in the breastfed infants and there were no differences in the rates of oral thrush in infants between the treatments.[6] A systematic review concluded that this practice is not justified based on current evidence.[7]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Albendazole and its active metabolite are minimally excreted into breastmilk. An informal consultation group to the World Health Organization concluded that a single oral dose of albendazole can be given to lactating women.[1]"
    drug_levels: "Albendazole is poorly absorbed orally and is extensively metabolized to the active metabolite albendazole sulfoxide via extensive first-pass metabolism by CYP3A4. It is further metabolized to the inactive metabolite, albendazole sulfone. Maternal Levels: Thirty-three women who were breastfeeding infants between 2 weeks and 6 months of age were given a single dose of albendazole 400 mg orally. Milk samples were obtained before the dose and 6, 12, 24 and 36 h after drug administration. Maternal blood samples were obtained 6 hours after drug administration. Albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, and albendazole sulfone were measured in maternal blood and milk samples. Pharmacokinetic parameters for albendazole sulfoxide were calculated using data from 20 of the women who provided 3 or more milk samples. The mean peak milk concentration was 352 mcg/L which occurred at a mean of 6.9 hours. It had a half-life in breastmilk of 12.4 hours. Albendazole sulfoxide concentration 36 hours after the dose averaged 57 mcg/L; both albendazole and albendazole sulfone were undetectable (  < 661 mcg/L) in milk at this time. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would be exposed to less than 0.1 mg/kg of albendazole sulfoxide over a 36-hour period following a maternal dose of 400 mg and even less of albendazole.[2] This translates into an infant dosage of less than 1.5% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage.Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

The infant began 5 months of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 hours after birth. On day 2, the infant developed electrolyte abnormalities consisting of hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic acidosis. The infant was treated with oral calcium gluconate and a single dose of intramuscular magnesium sulfate. Despite continued breastfeeding and maternal drug therapy, the infant's mild metabolic acidosis disappeared on day 4 of life and the infant was gaining weight normally at 1, 3 and 8 months, but had mild hypotonicity. The authors considered the metabolic effects to be caused by transplacental passage of acetazolamide that resolved despite the infant being breastfed. The infant gained weight adequately during breastfeeding, but had some mild, residual hypertonicity of the lower limbs requiring physical therapy.[2]"

Her infant was exclusively breastfed until 4 months of age and the drug was reinstituted on day 24 postpartum. At 7 months of age, the infant was healthy with normal growth and development. The infant had no infections requiring antibiotics or hospitalization.[9] A prospective cohort study followed	pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease throughout pregnancy and for 12 months postpartum. Women were assigned to one of the following groups: unexposed (no thiopurines or anti-TNF agents); group A (azathioprine or mercaptopurine); group B (infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab) and group AB (both a thiopurine and an anti-TNF agent). Of 1052 women enrolled in the study, 72% breastfed their infants, although the extent and duration were not stated in the abstract. A total of 102 women were exposed to an anti-TNF agent and 59 were exposed to a thiopurine plus an anti-TNF agent. The use of an anti-TNF alone was not associated with any complication in the infants and their growth and development were normal throughout the 12 months. Infants exposed to both a thiopurine and an anti-TNF agent had a 50% increase in the number of infections between 9 and 12 months of age. The relationship of this increase with breastfeeding could not be determined from the available data.[13]"

In addition, because gadopentetate is poorly absorbed orally, it is not likely to reach the bloodstream of the infant or cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. Gadopentetate has been associated with some cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with renal impairment. On this theoretical basis, European sources recommend that the mother pump and discard milk for 24 hours after receiving gadopentetate.[1][2] However, guidelines developed by several North American professional organizations state that breastfeeding need not be disrupted after a nursing mother receives a gadolinium-containing contrast medium.[3][4][5]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A lactating woman who was weaning her infant (time postpartum not stated) was given an intravenous dose of 5.8 mmol (5.4 g) of gadopentetate dimeglumine which was equivalent to 0.1 mmol/kg. Samples of expressed breastmilk were obtained 6 times during the following 32.7 hours with the mother trying to completely empty the breasts at each time. Milk was analyzed for elemental gadolinium. The highest amount of gadolinium in milk of 5.1 micromol/L was detected at 4.8 hours after the dose. At 22 hours after the dose, milk levels were less than 1 micromol/L. About 0.66 micromol (0.6 mg) of gadopentetate was excreted over the time of milk collection. This amounted to about 0.01% of the mother's total (not weight-adjusted) dose.[6] A mother who was 13 weeks postpartum was given an intravenous dose of 7 mmol (6.6 g) of gadopentetate dimeglumine which was equivalent to 0.1 mmol/kg. Breastmilk was collected from each breast at 2, 11, 17 and 24 hours after the dose. Milk was analyzed for elemental gadolinium. The highest amounts in milk were in the 2-hour sample, having 2.8 and 3.4 micromol/L (2.6 and 3.2 mg/L) in the milk from each breast respectively. At 11 hours, the values were 2.8 and 2.9 micromol/L; by hour 17, the amounts in milk were at or below the detection limit of about 1 micromol/L. The authors estimated that 1.6 micromoles (1.5 mg) or 0.023% of the maternal dose (not weight-adjusted) would be excreted in the 24 hours after administration.[7] Nineteen women received intravenous gadopentetate, in a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg (n = 18) or 0.2 mmol/kg (n = 1). The mothers withheld nursing for 24 hours and emptied both breasts completely at times chosen by the mother based on her own normal breastfeeding times. For the 18 subjects who received the lower dose, the average dose in milk was 5.9 mmol (range 4.8 to 7.4 mmol). The woman who received double the dose had milk gadolinium excretion in the same range as the others. Milk was analyzed for elemental gadolinium. The time of the peak gadolinium level in milk varied between 1 and 8 hours after the dose in 15 of the women; in 3 women, the peak values occurred at 9, 11 and 13 hours after the dose. The total amount excreted in milk averaged 0.57 micromoles (range 0.052 to 3 micromoles). The average amount excreted was 0.009% of the administered dose (range 0.001 to 0.4%). The authors concluded that breastfed infants would ingest less than 1% of the usual maximal neonatal dose of 0.2 mmol/kg and that this dose would not warrant discontinuing breastfeeding after gadopentetate administration.[8] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

Additionally, more patients' condition worsened (28% vs 5%) with mupirocin than with an oral antibiotic.[3] In a randomized, double-bind trial, lanolin was compared to an all-purpose nipple ointment containing mupirocin 1%, betamethasone 0.05%, and miconazole 2% for painful nipples while nursing in the first 2 weeks postpartum. The two treatments were equally effective in reducing nipple pain, nipple healing time, breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding exclusivity rate, mastitis and nipple symptoms, side effects or maternal satisfaction with treatment.[4]"

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A review article states that 2 women excreted totals of 0.7 and 0.2 mg in their milk after a single oral dose of 500 mg of terbinafine.[4] The details of this study were obtained from the manufacturer (Sandoz). Two healthy women aged 32 and 33 years and weighing 57.9 kg and 53.1 kg, respectively, were not breastfeeding, but had some milk production. They were each given four 125 mg tablets of terbinafine after an 8-hour fast. All milk was collected at 6-hour intervals for 72 hours after the dose. The highest concentrations of terbinafine in milk occurred in the first 6-hour aliquot and were 7.3 and 7.9 mg/L, respectively. In the 6- to 12-hour sample, milk concentrations were 2.0 and 2.4 mg/L. In the 12- to 18-hour sample, milk concentrations were 0.15 and 0.25 mg/L. After 18 hours, terbinafine was undetectable (  < 150 mcg/L[5]) by HPLC assay in milk. The major metabolite of terbinafine was undetectable (  < 150 mcg/L[5]) by HPLC assay in all aliquots. The cumulative amounts in milk over the 18 hours after the dose were 0.65 mg and 0.15 mg, respectively (noted above as rounded values). Milk production over this time period was 218 mL and  41 mL, respectively.[6] Using the average milk concentration values over the 24-hour period in the 2 subjects, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 3.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of terbinafine. The package insert in the United States states that milk concentrations of terbinafine are 7-fold maternal plasma concentrations. Communication with the US manufacturer, Novartis, indicates that this value was derived from an animal experiment (species not specified). This value is far higher than that found in humans.[6] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

Seventy-three percent of the 108 infants were breastfed until 3 to 12 weeks postpartum. No serious adverse event occurred in any of the infants and the mothers who breastfed had outcomes as good as those who did not.[7] A case series reported 43 women with multiple sclerosis who received 60 grams of IVIG within 3 days of delivery and 10 grams monthly. All of the women breastfed their infants for at least 4 weeks. The only adverse effect reported in infants was a transient rash one day after a maternal dose of IVIG which was possibly caused by the IVIG. The relapse rate was lower than with historical controls who did not receive IVIG.[8] A European double-blind, randomized trial compared two IVIG regimens in 168 postpartum mothers with multiple sclerosis to observe the relapse rate. One group received 150 mg/kg within 24 hours of delivery and monthly for 6 months. The other group received 450 mg/kg within 24 hours of delivery, 300 mg/kg on day 2 and 150 mg/kg on day 3 postpartum followed by monthly doses of 150 mg/kg until 6 months postpartum. More mothers who breastfed for 3 months or longer were relapse free during the study than those who did not breastfed or who breastfed less than 3 months. In all, 91 mothers breastfed for 3 months or longer and 48 mothers breastfed for less than 3 months. No mention was made of adverse effects in breastfed infants.[9] A woman with pemphigoid gestationis was treated with several courses of intravenous immune globulin 2 grams/kg over 3 days during pregnancy as well as at 4, 9 and 13 weeks postpartum. She was also receiving prednisolone in a dosage tapering from 0.7 mg/kg daily to 1 mg daily. She breastfed her infant (extent not stated) for 3 months with no problems noted.[10] In a study comparing the timing of intravenous immune globulin on the relapse of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, 24 patients were treated with intravenous immune globulin starting in the first 24 hours after delivery and during lactation. The authors concluded that intravenous immune globulin is effective in reducing the frequency of postpartum-related relapses. No adverse effects were noted.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Sulpiride is not approved for marketing in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration, but is used as a psychotherapeutic agent and galactogogue in other countries. Sulpiride increases serum prolactin, but its clinical value in increasing milk supply is questionable. In a study that enrolled only mothers with documented low milk production a few weeks postpartum, sulpiride was effective in increasing milk volume, but it was only more effective than placebo in avoiding supplementation in those with no initial milk production. Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production.[1] If mothers are provided instruction in good breastfeeding technique and breastfeed frequently, sulpiride is unlikely to provide additional benefit. Whether sulpiride has any benefit as a galactogogue in women who continue to have insufficient milk production after nursing technique and frequency have been optimized has not been studied adequately.<br><br>  Sulpiride is excreted into breastmilk in rather large amounts, far above the accepted value of 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage in some cases, but blood concentrations in breastfed infants have not been evaluated. Two studies found no adverse effects in breastfed infants whose mothers were treated with sulpiride for 2 to 4 weeks as a galactogogue.<br><br>  Postpartum mothers are at a relatively high risk for postpartum depression and sulpiride can cause depression as a side effect. Therefore, sulpiride should probably be avoided in women with a history of major depression and not used for prolonged periods in any mothers during this time of high susceptibility. Tiredness occurred occasionally and cases of headache and leg edema have also been reported in nursing mothers taking sulpiride as a galactogogue.[2][3]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: In a study reported only in abstract form, sulpiride was not detected in milk (study details and assay limit not stated) with maternal dosages of up to 200 mg daily.[4] Twenty women were taking sulpiride 50 mg twice daily by mouth to enhance milk production. A single milk sample from each woman was taken at 2 hours after the morning dose between the 3rd to the 7th day of therapy. The average milk sulpiride concentration was 970 mcg/L (range 260 to 1970 mcg/L).[5] This translates to an average maximum infant dosage of 146 mcg/kg/day (range 39 to 297 mcg/kg/day) in the infant or 8.7% (range 2 to 18%) of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage. Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In a study of 14 women given sulpiride 50 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks, no side effects were reported in their breastfed infants.[3] In a study of 24 nursing mothers who received sulpiride 50 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks, no side effects were reported in their breastfed infants.[2] In a study comparing sulpiride to placebo for enhancement of milk production, infant weight gain was greater in the infants of treated women up to day 15, but there was no difference in weight gain between the groups thereafter.[6]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Several studies have been published on the use of sulpiride in enhancing milk supply.[2][3][5][6][7][8][9] Most of the studies have serious design flaws. Although these studies were all placebo controlled, only 3 studies were blinded and randomized. In one study, 28 women were randomized to sulpiride 50 mg (n = 14) or placebo (n = 14) 3 times daily for 4 weeks. Women were within 4 months postpartum and had identified themselves as having insufficient milk. The two groups were fairly well matched at the initiation of the trial except that mothers in the placebo group had been supplementing for longer than women in the sulpiride group, 33 and 22 days, respectively. Mothers in both groups fed their infants an average of 5.3 times daily. Mothers were given no instruction on breastfeeding technique. Serum prolactin rose in sulpiride-treated patients to about 400 mcg/L and fell slightly in placebo-treated patients. However, neither milk yields at the beginning of the study nor increases in yield showed any relationship to increases in serum prolactin. Infant weight gain was greater in the treated patients at the end of the study (1081 vs 795 g); however, most of the infants in both groups were supplemented, so it is impossible to tell if the weight gain in the sulpiride group was caused by increased milk production or by the supplementation.[3]A study of 66 primiparous mothers with normal infants who expressed a desire to breastfeed, received sulpiride 100 mg 3 times daily for the first 4 days postpartum, then 50 mg 3 times daily for the next 86 days. Mothers who received sulpiride maintained elevated baseline serum prolactin levels of 117 to 119 mcg/L throughout the 90-day study period. Mothers taking placebo had a normal drop in serum prolactin from 113 mcg/L on day 1 to 20 mcg/L on day 90; however, on days 4, 15 and 30, their 30-minute postsuckling prolactin levels reached about the same levels as the sulpiride-treated mothers because they had very small increases in prolactin after nursing. At days 60 and 90, women taking placebo had much lower baseline and postsuckling prolactin levels than treated women. Infant weight gain was greater in the infants of treated women up to day 15, but there was no difference between the groups thereafter.[6] This study suffered from a high 38% dropout rate, which makes intent-to-treat analysis unfeasible. A randomized, double-blind trial studied 60 women who were 25 to 40 days postpartum, 40 with insufficient lactation averaging 293 mL/day and 20 with no milk production at the start of the study. No mention was made of any lactation education given to the subjects before or during the study or the frequency of nursing during the study. Subjects were given l-sulpiride, d-sulpiride or d,l-sulpiride 50 mg twice daily or placebo for 15 days. Milk production increased in all drug groups. All women with insufficient lactation, including those receiving placebo, could avoid supplementation after 6 days of therapy. Women with no milk production at the start who received a drug were able to stop supplementation after 10 to 15 days; those in the placebo group were not able to breastfeed at the end of the study. The authors state that the increased milk production declined progressively after drug discontinuation, but did not provide any data.[8]"

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A woman receiving oral imatinib 400 mg daily for chronic myeloid leukemia breastfed her infant. During week 4 postpartum, serum and milk levels of imatinib and its active metabolite (CGP 74588) were measured before and at several times during the 9 hours after the dose. The highest concentrations of imatinib and its metabolite were at 2 and 4 hours after the dose. Peak concentrations of imatinib ranged between 1.1 and 1.4 mg/L and were 0.8 mg/L for the metabolite. The concentrations of both were 25 to 50% lower 9 hours after the dose. Milk and serum levels were also measured during the second month of breastfeeding with similar results (details not reported).[2] Using these data, the estimated maximum dosage of the drug and metabolite that a fully breastfed infant would receive is 0.3 mg/kg daily or 4.5% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. A woman who was 7 days postpartum and had been taking imatinib 400 mg daily since the middle of her pregnancy had a single milk sample analyzed for the drug an its metabolite. Imatinib concentration 15 hours after a dose was 596 mcg/L and CGP 74588 was 1513 mcg/L. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive between 1.2 and 2 mg of the drug and metabolite daily with this maternal dose.[3] A woman who took imatinib 400 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum delivered a normal infant, but did not breastfeed. Breastmilk imatinib concentrations were measured on the 7th, 14th, 15th and 16th days postpartum at times ranging from 10 to 16 hours after the previous dose. Breastmilk concentrations ranged between 1.4 and 2.6 mg/L.[4] A woman with chronic myeloid leukemia was begun on imatinib 400 mg daily immediately after delivery.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "The effects of maternal alcohol (ethanol) ingestion during lactation are complex and depend on the pattern of maternal drinking. Alcohol decreases milk production with 5 drinks or more decreasing milk letdown and disrupting nursing until maternal alcohol levels decrease. Beer may increase serum prolactin levels during nursing because of polysaccharides from barley and hops. After ingestion of nonalcoholic beer, the antioxidant capacity of milk is increased, but alcohol levels in milk are negligible. Women with a family history of alcoholism have a blunted prolactin response following breast stimulation and tend to breastfeed more frequently to compensate.<br><br>  Breastmilk alcohol levels closely parallel blood alcohol levels. The highest alcohol levels in milk occur 30 to 60 minutes after an alcoholic beverage, but food delays the time of peak milk alcohol levels. Nursing after 1 or 2 drinks (including beer) can decrease the infant's milk intake by 20 to 23% and cause infant agitation and poor sleep patterns. The long-term effects of daily use of alcohol on the infant are unclear. Some evidence indicates that infant growth and motor function may be negatively affected by 1 drink or more daily, but other studies have not confirmed these findings. Heavy maternal use may cause excessive sedation, fluid retention, and hormone imbalances in breastfed infants.<br><br>  Casual use of alcohol (such as 1 glass of wine or beer per day) is unlikely to cause either short- or long-term problems in the nursing infant,[1] especially if the mother waits 2 to 2.5 hours per drink before nursing, and does not appear to affect breastfeeding duration. Daily heavy use of alcohol (more than 2 drinks daily) may affect infants negatively and appears to decrease the length of time that mothers breastfeed their infants. Nursing or pumping within 1 hour before ingesting alcohol may slightly reduce the subsequent amounts of alcohol in breastmilk."
    drug_levels: "The alcohol (absolute ethanol) content of various drinks are as follows: 12 fluid ounces of beer (4.5%) = 12.6 g; 4 fluid ounces of table wine (12%) = 11.2 g; 1 fluid ounce of whiskey (100 proof) = 11.7 g. Blood alcohol is often reported as a percent; a concentration of 1 grams/L of alcohol is equivalent to 0.1%. Maternal Levels: Five nursing mothers drank 0.4 grams/kg of alcohol as vodka (about 2 drinks for a 60 kg woman) over 1 minute after a standard breakfast and followed the drink with 80 mL of water. Blood and milk samples were collected over the next 3 hours. Eight additional women who were not breastfeeding followed the same protocol. Blood and milk alcohol levels had a later peak in lactating women (48 minutes) than in the lactating women (31 minutes). The bioavailability of alcohol in the lactating women was 74% of bioavailability in the nonlactating women; peak blood alcohol concentrations were numerically lower, but not statistically different from the nonlactating women. Milk alcohol levels closely paralleled blood alcohol levels with an average peak level of 0.44 grams/L, falling to about 0.35 grams/L at 90 minutes and about 0.09 grams/L at 3 hours after the dose.[2] Twelve women between 4 and 41 weeks postpartum drank a 0.6 grams/kg of alcohol (about 3 drinks for a 60 kg woman) as a 15% solution over 5 minutes on an empty stomach. Blood and milk samples were obtained every 30 minutes for 2 hours. Alcohol concentrations in milk closely paralleled blood concentrations with the highest concentration averaging 1.05 grams/L at 1 hour after the dose. By 2 hours, the alcohol concentration in milk was 0.7 grams/L. Acetaldehyde, the major metabolite of alcohol, was undetectable in milk (assay limit not stated), but was detectable in maternal blood.[3] Eight nursing mothers with infants ranging in age from 6 weeks to 2 years 9 months rapidly drank from 0.46 to 1.5 grams/kg of alcohol after a small meal. The time of peak alcohol concentrations varied from 1 to 2.5 hours after the initial ingestion of alcohol; however, some of the women drank their alcoholic beverage over a 1 hour period. Both fore- and hindmilk levels closely paralleled blood alcohol concentrations.[4] Twelve nursing mothers with infants 25 to 216 days of age drank 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol (about 1.5 drinks for a 60 kg woman) in orange juice over 15 minutes in the morning. Prior food intake was not controlled. Milk samples were collected over 3 hours. The average peak level of alcohol in milk was 0.32 grams/L at 1 hours after the end of alcohol ingestion. Milk alcohol concentrations were 0.2 grams/L at 2 hours and  0.05 grams/L at 3 hours after the end of alcohol ingestion. Using the volume of milk taken by the infant at the one nearest nursing time, the authors estimated that a breastfed infant would receive between 0.5 to 3.3% of the mothers weight-adjusted dosage.[5]Two groups of Mexican mothers were studied after receiving an average of either 0.21 or 0.4 grams/kg of alcohol as pulque after breakfast. Blood and milk samples were taken at 60, 90 and 120 minutes after pulque ingestion. They were exclusively breastfeeding their infants who were 3 to 21 months of age. Milk alcohol concentrations paralleled blood alcohol, with the highest milk levels at the first measurement at 60 minutes after ingestion. The group of mothers who consumed higher doses of alcohol eliminated it more slowly from blood and milk.[6] A dose of 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol (about 1.5 drinks for a 60 kg woman) was administered over 15 minutes to 23 Chinese nursing mothers in a chicken-based soup following a cereal snack. Samples of blood and milk were taken during the following 135 minutes. The time of peak milk alcohol levels varied among women between 20 and 40 minutes after the dose. Milk alcohol levels were similar to blood levels, but fell slightly more slowly. At 135 minutes after soup ingestion, the average breastmilk alcohol concentration was 9.05 mg/dL. The authors estimated that milk alcohol levels returned to 0 at about 175 minutes after ingestion.[7][8] A study compared alcohol pharmacokinetics in 20 lactating women to that in 9 formula-feeding women and 15 nulliparous women. Women were tested twice, once fasting and once after a standard breakfast. Subjects received 0.4 grams/kg of alcohol (about 2 drinks for a 60 kg woman) in 2 doses 5 minutes apart, an hour after the meal on the fed days. Blood alcohol was estimated from breath alcohol levels over a 205 minute period. The average bioavailability of alcohol in the lactating women was 82% of bioavailability in the nonlactating women; peak blood alcohol concentrations in the lactating women were lower than in the nonlactating women, especially than the nulliparous women. Postpartum women, both lactating and nonlactating, felt sedated by the alcohol for a shorter period of time than nulliparous women.[9] A nomogram was developed using pharmacokinetic principles to estimate the duration of alcohol in milk. The time to eliminate a standard drink of about 12 g of alcohol varied with the weight of the woman. For a 54 kg (120 lb) woman, 2.5 hours after finishing the drink is required to eliminate the alcohol from her milk. For a 68 kg (150 lb) woman 2.25 hours is required ; for an 82 kg (180 lb) woman, 2 hours is required. For each additional drink consumed, the same number of hours should pass. For example, a 150 kg woman consuming 4 drinks should wait 9 hours before resuming breastfeeding to ensure that the infant does not receive any alcohol.[10] A study of 10 women of varying weights who consumed 16 fluid ounces of table wine found general agreement between their results and this nomogram.[11] Sixteen lactating women who were 3 to 5 months postpartum pumped milk either 1 hour before or 0.6 hours after ingesting 0.4 mg/kg of ethanol. Blood alcohol concentrations were measured several times between 0.4 and 3.4 hours after alcohol ingestion. Each woman underwent this test on 2 occasions, once fasting and once after a meal. Eating before alcohol ingestion reduced and delayed the peak blood alcohol concentrations, and reduced the total alcohol absorption and elimination rate. Pumping before alcohol ingestion caused similar effects, but of a smaller magnitude, and the two effects were additive or synergistic.[12] Milk alcohol concentrations were not measured, but likely paralleled  the blood concentrations closely. Fifteen women drank 1.5 L of nonalcoholic beer (0.42% alcohol by volume) over about 1 hour. Breastmilk samples were obtained at the completion of alcohol ingestion, plus 1 and 3 hours later. Two women had detectable levels of alcohol in their breastmilk at the termination of drinking (0.0021 and   < 0.001 grams/L). All other samples had undetectable (  < 0.0006 grams/L) levels of alcohol. The authors concluded that drinking nonalcoholic beer by a nursing mother is unlikely to affect their breastfed infant.[13] Infant Levels: A computer simulation of breastfed infant serum alcohol levels after maternal ingestion of 250 mL of wine estimated resulting blood alcohol concentrations of  0.0033% in newborn infants and 0.0038% in 3-month-old infants.[14] Another group estimated that if a woman ingested 4 standard drinks at once and breastfed her infant, the infant would attain a blood alcohol concentration of 0.049 g/L (0.0049%).[1]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A nursing mother was drinking large amounts of quinine wine, wine, champagne, beer and liquors. Her infant had been gaining 30 g of weight A nursing mother was drinking large amounts of quinine wine, wine, champagne, beer and liquors. Her infant had been gaining 30 g of weight daily until he weighed nearly 6 kg at 5 weeks of age. The infant had been restless and sleepless for several days when he suffered from violent fits and tonic-clonic seizures that required medical treatment. After he was taken off the mother's breast and began to be nursed by a wet nurse, his weight quickly dropped by 200 g in 3 days and fell into a pattern of calm sleep.[15] A similar case of chronic heavy alcohol use by a nursing mother resulted in pseudo-Cushing syndrome in her 4-month-old breastfed infant. The infant had a bloated appearance, excessive wight gain and diminished length for age. The mother reported drinking 50 cans of beer weekly and \"generous\" amounts of other alcoholic beverages to increase her milk supply. The infant's symptoms resolved and growth pattern returned to normal after her mother stopped consuming alcohol.[16]A series of 23 cases of severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding were reported among 21- to 60-day old breastfed infants of Chinese women in Singapore over a 5-year period. None of the infants had received prophylactic vitamin K at birth and all of their mothers had been taking alcohol tonics after each meal beginning at 7 to 10 days after delivery which was a common practice among only the Chinese in the mixed ethnic population delivering at the hospital. Most of the infants had also been receiving 5 to 15 mL daily of \"gripe water\" which had an alcohol content of about 5%. The authors attributed these cases to the lack of prophylactic vitamin K (which was common practice at the time) and increased clotting factor degradation caused by alcohol.[17] A woman who drank 750 mL of port wine in 24 hours noticed that her breastfed 8-day-old had a deep unarousable sleep, snoring, pain insensitivity, inability to suck, excessive perspiration and a feeble pulse. These symptoms were attributed to the very young age of the infant and the large amount of alcohol consumed.[18] In a series of studies, investigators measured the effect of maternal alcohol use on their breastfed infants. In one study, 12 nursing mothers with infants 25 to 216 days of age drank 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol (about 1.5 drinks for a 60 kg woman) in orange juice over 15 minutes in the morning. On a separate occasion, they drank an equal volume of orange juice.[5] In another study, 12 nursing mothers nursing infants with a median age of 150 days drank 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol as beer or the same volume of nonalcoholic beer on a separate occasion.[19] In a third study, 12 nursing mothers with infants averaging 3.1 months of age drank 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol in orange juice over 15 minutes in the morning. On a separate occasion, they drank an equal volume of orange juice In both studies, infants who drank milk that contained alcohol consumed 20 to 23% less milk during the 3- or 4-hour testing session, even though the time spent at the breast and number of sucks was unchanged. Mothers could perceive no difference in milk production or nursing behavior in their infants. Infants sucked more vigorously on a bottle containing their mothers' milk spiked with alcohol than on mothers' milk alone.[20] In a study in which infants were weighed by the mothers before and after each feeding for the next 16 hours (20 hours total), infants increased the number of nursings during the period of  8 to 12 hours after the alcohol intake such that the total amount of milk consumed during the 20-hour period did not differ between the alcohol and non-alcohol days.[21] In studies that measured infant sleep, infants slept more frequently for shorter periods of time during the 3.5 to 4 hours after alcohol intake, whether it was after mothers drank 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol before breastfeeding or infants were given their mothers' milk spiked with an amount of alcohol (32 mg/100 mL) equivalent to that at 1 hour after maternal ingestion of 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol.[5][22][23] After ingesting the alcohol-containing milk after maternal consumption of 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol, 14 infants from 4 to 11 weeks of age infants were observed for 1 hour after milk ingestion. Their behavioral state changed more frequently, they slept less, cried more and startled more than after consuming milk without alcohol. Mother-infant interactions were more conflictive after alcohol intake which may partially explain increased infant arousal after maternal and infant alcohol ingestion.[24] A study that monitored the infants during the 24-hour period after maternal alcohol ingestion revealed that the infants compensated by spending more time in active (rapid eye movement) sleep from 3.5 hours to 24 hours with no further alcohol intake.[23] Long-term effects of alcohol ingestion during breastfeeding were studied in 2 separate populations by one group of investigators. In the first study, alcohol intake of more than 1 drink daily during nursing produced a measurable decrease in motor function development, but not mental development at 1 year of age.[25] A later follow-up study found no decrements in performance of 18-month-old infants who were breastfed by mothers who consumed alcohol.[26] Studies have examined the effects of ingestion of pulque, an alcohol-containing drink made from agave cactus, in rural Mexican women. Most of the women had ingested pulque daily during pregnancy and lactation. One study found no effects on weight or length growth velocity among the 32 infants at 3 and 6 months of age whose mothers ingested an average of about 30 g of alcohol daily compared to the infants of 62 infants who did not drink pulque.[27] Another study compared the growth of 40 infants whose mothers ingested pulque during lactation and 18 whose mothers did not. Mothers who consumed pulque ingested an average of 16.3 g daily. The infants whose mothers ingested pulque regularly had poorer growth between 1 and 57 months and smaller size at 57 months.[28] A retrospective study of 222 inner city women reported only as an abstract found that 1-year-old breastfed infants scored higher on language skills and motor development and had fewer hearing problems than nonbreastfed infants. Alcohol use by the mothers did not decrease the beneficial effects of breastfeeding.[29] A subgroup analysis of a large cohort study in Norway found that the infants of mothers who drank alcohol during breastfeeding had no greater risk of asthma, allergy or lower respiratory infections at 36 months of age than infants of mothers who did not drink.[30]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Studies in mothers who were 2 to 8 days postpartum found that acute doses of alcohol infused intravenously reduced the oxytocin-mediated milk ejection reflex following infant sucking. The effect could be overridden by administration of exogenous oxytocin, indicating that alcohol inhibits oxytocin release, not its effect on the breast.[31] Alcohol doses of 0.5 to 0.99 grams/kg reduced oxytocin response to infants sucking by 18%; doses of 1 to 1.49 grams/kg reduced the response by 62%; and doses from 1.5 to 1.99 grams/kg reduced the response by 80%. Alcohol also increased the time for letdown to occur after nipple stimulation, from 29 seconds to 64 seconds with doses of 1 to 1.49 grams/kg and from 38 seconds to 331 seconds with doses of 1.5 to 1.99 grams/kg.[32] Other investigators found that drinking 100 mL of whiskey containing a total of 50 mL of absolute alcohol (about 4 drinks in a 60 kg woman) abolished the rise in serum oxytocin in response to breast stimulation with a breast pump in 16 nonpregnant, nonlactating women. Pretreatment with naloxone blunted alcohol's inhibitory effect on oxytocin release.[33] Acute alcohol ingestion can either increase, decrease or have no effect on serum prolactin in nonpregnant, nonlactating women.[34][35][36] Drinking 100 mL of whiskey containing a total of 50 mL of absolute alcohol lessened the increase in serum prolactin in response to breast stimulation with a breast pump in 11 nonpregnant, nonlactating women. Serum prolactin rose by 71% over baseline 20 minutes after stimulation without alcohol and only by 25% after alcohol consumption. Pretreatment with naloxone blunted alcohol's inhibitory effect, with the combination resulting in a 46% rise in serum prolactin over baseline.[37] It is not clear how these finding apply to lactating women. A study on 30 lactating women who were 2 to 4 months postpartum found that the normal rise in serum prolactin was enhanced when alcohol in a dose of 0.4 gramskg was taken 35 minutes before breast stimulation with a breast pump. In subjects with a first-degree relative who was alcoholic, the increase in serum prolactin was less than in other subjects, both with and without prior alcohol consumption.[38] Nursing mothers who ingested a 0.3 grams/kg dose of alcohol produced an average of 9.3% less milk 2 hours after the alcohol intake using a breast pump than they did when a nonalcoholic beverage was taken. The caloric content and composition of milk were not different during the two test periods.[39] A 1-year long survey of 587 new mothers in Australia found that women who drank more than 2 standard drinks (10 grams or 12.5 mL of absolute alcohol) daily were twice a s likely to discontinue breastfeeding by 6 months postpartum.[40] Beer specifically has a reputation for increasing milk supply.[41] A small crossover study found that ingestion of 1 liter of beer containing 6% alcohol by 11 nonpregnant, nonlactating women increased serum prolactin by nearly 2.5-fold 30 minutes after ingestion, but sparkling water with an equivalent amount of alcohol did not.[42] In another study, 7 nonpregnant, nonlactating women were give 800 mL of beer. Six drank beer containing 4.5% alcohol and 1 woman drank nonalcoholic beer. Their average peak serum prolactin increased to 2.4 times the baseline value between 60 and 105 minutes after ingestion. The one woman who drank nonalcoholic beer had an equivalent prolactin response. Pretreatment with naloxone had no effect on the prolactin response.[43] Studies in animals indicate that a polysaccharide found in barley and malt is apparently responsible for the increase in prolactin after beer ingestion.[44][45] The interaction between alcohol ingestion and breast pumping was investigated in a double-blind crossover study of 13 lactating women who were exclusively nursing 2- to 5-month-old infants. Compared to placebo, ingestion of 0.4 mg/kg of alcohol increased serum prolactin during the ascending phase of blood alcohol concentrations. Pumping milk from the breasts during the ascending phase of blood alcohol enhanced the prolactin response, but pumping during the descending phase of blood alcohol blunted the prolactin increase. Milk production was lower after alcohol ingestion, but unrelated to serum prolactin or alcohol blood concentrations.[46] Twenty-three Taiwanese nursing mothers received a chicken-based soup following a cereal snack twice during the first 15 days postpartum. On one occasion the soup contained a dose of 0.3 grams/kg of alcohol (about 1.5 drinks for a 60 kg woman) and on the other occasion the soup was alcohol free. The time for the first drops of milk to be ejected was longer (2.9 vs 4.4 seconds) after the alcohol-containing soup than with the nonalcoholic soup. In addition, the triacylglycerol (14.8 vs 12.3 mg/dL) and lactate (0.8 vs 0.6 mg/dL) content of breastmilk were greater at 135 minutes after ingesting the alcohol-containing soup than the nonalcoholic soup.[8] A study compared the prolactin response of 7 non-alcohol-dependent women with a family history of alcoholism to 21 women with no family history of alcoholism. Participants were given a dose of 0.4 grams/kg of alcohol or placebo in a crossover fashion on 2 days. A breast pump was used to collect breastmilk beginning 35 minutes after ingesting the test solution. Blood samples were collected for prolactin before and at various times after beverage consumption. The women with a family history of alcoholism had reduced serum prolactin responses to breast stimulation whether or not they had consumed alcohol. They tended to nurse their infants more frequently than the other mothers, apparently as a method of compensation.[42] Nursing mothers whose diets were supplemented with 660 mL daily of nonalcoholic beer had increases in the antioxidant capacity of their plasma and breastmilk. The coenzyme Q10 content of milk was higher at day 30 in the supplemented mothers. No change in oxidant markers was found in their infants' urine.[47]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Caffeine appears in breastmilk rapidly after maternal ingestion. Fussiness, jitteriness and poor sleep patterns have been reported in the infants of mothers with very high caffeine intakes equivalent to about 10 or more cups of coffee daily. Studies in mothers taking 5 cups of coffee daily found no stimulatory effects on infants 3 weeks of age and older. Some experts feel that a maternal intake limit of 300 mg daily might be a safe level of intake.[1] However, preterm and younger newborn infants metabolize caffeine very slowly and may have serum levels of caffeine and other active caffeine metabolites similar to their mothers' levels,[1][2][3] so a lower intake level preferable in the mothers of these infants. Other sources of caffeine, such as cola and energy drinks, yerba mate or guarana, will have similar dose-related effects on the breastfed infant. Coffee intake of more than 450 mL daily may decrease breastmilk iron concentrations and result in mild iron deficiency anemia in some breastfed infants.[4]"
    drug_levels: "The half-life of caffeine in late pregnancy is much longer than in nonpregnant women; however, the maternal half-life returns to normal within the first week postpartum.[5] Smokers have more rapid clearance of caffeine and shorter half-lives than nonsmokers because smoking induces CYP1A2. Caffeine clearance is very low in preterm and newborn infants, but reaches adult values by 3 to 5 months of age.[2] Maternal Levels: Caffeine appears in breastmilk with a peak usually occurring about 1 hour after a dose.[6][7][8] Most studies did not measure active metabolites in milk. Five women who were 4 months to 1 year postpartum were given a dose of 150 mg of caffeine orally as caffeine sodium benzoate solution 2 hours after breakfast. Average caffeine levels at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after the dose were 1.6, 1.5, and 0.9 mg/L, respectively. One woman also received a 300 mg dose on a separate occasion and her milk caffeine levels were about double those after her 150 mg dose.[9] Two nursing mothers who were 7 and 13 weeks postpartum ingested tablets containing a total of 128 mg of caffeine. Milk samples were taken over 12 and 48 hours in the 2 women, respectively. Peak milk levels of 1.3 and 1.6 mg/L occurred at 1.5 and 2 hours, respectively.[7] A mother who drank 3 cups of coffee over a 1-hour period and then coffee at will throughout the day had milk caffeine concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.15 mg/L in 8 milk samples taken over a 10.5 hour period.[10]Fifteen women ingested a caffeine-containing beverage of their choice (coffee or tea) containing caffeine in amounts ranging from 35 to 336 mg. Their breastfed infants ranged from 2 weeks to 9 months of age. Eleven of the women had caffeine detectable in their breastmilk with peak levels ranging from 2.1 to 7.2 mg/L. The 4 mothers with undetectable caffeine (  < 0.2 mg/L) had ingested less than 100 mg of caffeine. The mean half-life of caffeine in milk was 6.1 hours.[6] Nine nursing mothers ingested 750 mg of caffeine (5 doses of 150 mg) in instant coffee daily for 5 days. Pooled 24-hour milk samples were collected on days 5 and 9 after no caffeine had been taken for 4 days. Caffeine concentration in the mothers' milk averaged 4.3 mg/L, ranging from undetectable (  < 0.25 mg/L) to 28.6 mg/L. By day 9, caffeine was undetectable in all milk samples. The authors estimated that at this caffeine intake, infants would receive 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg daily.[11] Eleven nursing mothers randomly consumed 5 cups of decaffeinated coffee or 5 cups of decaffeinated coffee with a total of 500 mg of added caffeine daily for 5 days in a randomized, double- blinded study. Their infants averaged 47 days (range 22 to 71 days) of age. During a 24-hour collection period on day 5, milk of the women who consumed caffeine contained an average of 3.1 mg/L, which amounted to an average of 2.4 mg or 0.5 mg/kg daily intake for the infants.[12] Six women who were 3.5 to 17 weeks postpartum were given a single oral tablet of caffeine containing 100 mg of caffeine. Ten breastmilk samples from each breast were collected over the next 24 hours. The average peak milk levels from both breasts was 2.5 mg/L at 1 hour after the dose. Caffeine concentrations in milk from both breasts fell with an average half-life of 7.2 hours.[8] Using milk AUC data from 5 of the women, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 10% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. Five nursing mothers who were 6 to 28 weeks postpartum received a single dose of 200 mg of caffeine as tablets. Blood and milk samples were taken over the next 24 hours for measurement of caffeine and 3 active caffeine metabolites, paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline. The peak caffeine levels in milk occurred at about 1 hour, but peak metabolite levels in milk occurred later at about 5 to 10 hours for paraxanthine and 10 to 15 hours for theobromine and theophylline. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a caffeine dose of 7% and a total xanthine dose of 18% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[3] Infant Levels: Nine infants, aged 14 days to 19 weeks of age had saliva caffeine levels measured after maternal ingestion of 1 cup of coffee. All but 2 were completely breastfed. Among the 7 fully breastfed infants, saliva caffeine levels ranged from 0.21 to 0.75 mg/L between 1 and 6 hours after the maternal ingestion of caffeine.[13] Fifteen nursing mothers ingested a beverage containing caffeine in amounts ranging from 35 to 336 mg. Caffeine was not detected (  < 0.2 mg/L) in the urine of any of their infants over the 5-hour collection period that began 2 hours after the maternal caffeine intake.[6]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Jitteriness in a 6-week-old breastfed infant reported by a mother who claimed to drink 4 to 5 cups of coffee and 2 to 3 bottles (about 480 mL each) of cola daily as well as occasional tea and cocoa. Upon examination, the infant was gaining weight appropriately, but had trembling and increased muscle tone. The infant's symptoms decreased markedly 2 weeks after his mother stopped all caffeine-containing beverages.[14] Restlessness and irritability were reported in a breastfed (extent not stated) 5-month-old infant whose mother drank 20 cups of coffee a day.[10] A physician who reported drinking at least 5 mugs of coffee, 4 mugs of tea and 1 can of cola daily breastfed 2 infants. The first slept for only brief periods and woke easily. The second baby was fretful and jumpy and also had poor sleep patterns until his mother stopped her caffeine intake.[15]Another physician who reportedly drank 1.7 to 2 liters of decaffeinated coffee daily had premature twins (age and extent of nursing not stated) who both seemed to be irritable, although the larger infant was partially supplemented with formula and seemed less affected. When her coffee consumption increased further, the smaller infant suffered convulsive-like episodes. All symptoms resolved 24 hours after coffee consumption ceased.[16] Parents of a 24-day old infant reported restlessness and irritability in their breastfed infant whose mother reported drinking about 0.5 liters of mate every other day.[17] Eleven nursing mothers randomly consumed 5 cups of decaffeinated coffee or 5 cups of decaffeinated coffee with 500 mg of added caffeine daily for 5 days in a randomized, double- blinded study. Their infants averaged 47 days (range 22 to 71 days) of age; the extent of nursing was not reported. At the end of each 5-day period, no effects of caffeine on sleep time and heart rate were found.[12] A cohort study of mothers' caffeine intake and its effect on nighttime awakening asked mothers to provide their caffeine intake during pregnancy and lactation and their infant's sleep pattern infant at 3 months of age. Women who ingested more than 300 mg of caffeine daily reported slightly more nighttime awakenings in their infants than those who ingested less than 300 mg daily, but the difference was not statistically significant. The authors concluded that a limit of 300 mg of caffeine daily is reasonable.[18] In a study of low-income nursing mothers in Costa Rica, subjects were divided into high-intake (over 450 mL daily) and nondrinkers of coffee. Infants of coffee drinkers had a lower birth weight, and decreased concentrations of maternal and infant hemoglobin and hematocrit at birth. Iron levels in breastmilk were also lower among coffee drinkers and their infants' hemoglobin and hematocrit values were lower at 1 month postpartum.[4]"

Milk samples from both breasts were obtained before and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours after the dose on day 4. Peak milk duloxetine levels occurred at an average of 6 hours after the dose. The amount of duloxetine excreted into breastmilk was approximately 7.4 mcg (range 3.6 to 15 mcg) daily in these women. The normalized milk excretion corresponded to an infant dosage of 0.2 mcg/kg/day or 0.14% (maximum 0. 0.25%) of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage. The excretion of duloxetine metabolites, which are inactive, into breastmilk was not studied.[1] A woman took oral extended-release duloxetine 60 mg daily (868 mcg/kg/day) during pregnancy and breastfeeding. On day 32 postpartum, milk samples were obtained 10 minutes and 6 hours after the dose. The first (trough) sample contained 31 mcg/L of duloxetine and the second (peak) sample contained 64 mcg/L. The authors calculated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive a dose of 7.1 mcg/kg daily at this maternal dosage, corresponding to 0.82% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage.[2] A woman with recurrent depression took duloxetine 60 mg daily throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. At 18 days postpartum, the mother collected milk samples before the daily dose and at 8 more times during the next 22.5 hours. The peak milk concentration occurred at about 7 hours after the dose. The average milk concentration over the 24-hour dosage interval was 51 mcg/L. Hindmilk concentrations were somewhat higher than foremilk concentrations at the 2 times when they were measured separately. The authors estimated that the infant received a duloxetine dose of 0.81% of the mothers weight-adjusted dose via breastmilk.[3] Infant Levels: An infant whose mother was taking oral extended-release duloxetine 60 mg daily was exclusively breastfed. On day 32 of life, a blood sample was obtained 4 hours after the last nursing which was 8 hours and 15 minutes after the mother's previous dose. Duloxetine was undetectable (  < 1 mcg/L) in the infant's plasma.[2] An infant was breastfed (extent not stated) by a mother taking duloxetine 60 mg daily.

Mothers taking an SRI had an onset of milk secretory activation (lactogenesis II) that was delayed by an average of 16.7 hours compared to controls (85.8 hours postpartum in the SRI-treated mothers and 69.1 h in the untreated mothers), which doubled the risk of delayed feeding behavior compared to the untreated group. However, the delay in lactogenesis II may not be clinically important, since there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the percentage of mothers experiencing feeding difficulties after day 4 postpartum.[4] After one nonpregnant woman began taking duloxetine, her serum prolactin increased and previous galactorrhea, which had decreased after stopping venlafaxine, increased again. After stopping duloxetine, her prolactin decreased to normal and galactorrhea ceased.[5] A woman who was taking duloxetine at an unspecified dose for depression reported a milky discharge from her nipples. She had not experienced this effect with previous antidepressant therapy. Her serum prolactin was elevated, and an MRI of her head found no tumors. Duloxetine was stopped and she was treated with escitalopram 20 mg daily and cabergoline 0.5 mg twice weekly for one month. At this time her serum prolactin was normal and the galactorrhea had stopped.[6] In a study of cases of hyperprolactinemia and its symptoms (e.g., gynecomastia) reported to a French pharmacovigilance center, duloxetine was not found to have an increased risk of causing hyperprolactinemia compared to other drugs.[7] A woman taking duloxetine 60 mg daily for depression complained of a milky breast discharge, breast fullness, and breast pain, after taking the drug for a total of 10 weeks. Duloxetine was discontinued and bupropion was started. Two weeks after stopping duloxetine, galactorrhea improved. Six weeks after stopping duloxetine, her serum prolactin had dropped from the previous level of 37.9 mcg/L to 20.2 mcg/L.[8] Her galactorrhea was probably caused by duloxetine."

The absorption of iodine can be marked after application to open wounds or mucous membranes. Exposure of mothers to unnecessary iodine who are or will be breastfeeding should be avoided or minimized to the extent possible by avoiding its use on maternal mucous membranes (e.g., vaginal use, wound therapy), avoiding prolonged contact time, avoiding repeated applications, and applying it to the smallest possible surface areas of the body. It is possible that maternal exposure to iodine near term could interfere with thyroid studies done as a part of newborn screening tests."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Iodine is a normal mineral in breastmilk that is essential for the infant's thyroid. The amounts of iodine in breastmilk vary with maternal iodine intake. A 1981-82 survey of 61 breastmilk samples from 37 women in North Carolina found a mean iodine concentration of 178 mcg/L (range 29 to 490 mcg/L).[7] A 2002-06 survey of 57 women in the Boston area found a similar mean concentration of 205 mcg/L (range 2.7 to 1968 mcg/L) and a median iodine breastmilk concentration of 157 mcg/L.[8] A study of 36 breastmilk samples from 18 different states in 2003-04 found a mean iodide breastmilk concentrations of 63.3 mcg/L (range 4.5 to 162 mcg/L).[9] Another study of 108 breastmilk samples from 10 women by the same authors found a mean iodide concentration of 87.9 mcg/L (range 3.1-334 mcg/L), and a median concentration of 55.2 mcg/L.[10] The reason for the differences in iodine values between these two studies and the above studies is not clear. Two women were given potassium iodide orally. One was given 325 mg orally 3 times daily to a total of 3.6 grams and the other was given 650 mg orally 3 times daily to a total of 4.6 grams. Milk samples were obtained after the eighth and eleventh doses in the first woman and 2 hours after the last dose in the second woman. The first woman had milk iodide concentrations of about 33 and 29 mg/L and the second had a concentration of about 38 mg/L.[11] The analytic method used in this old study was insensitive and imprecise by modern standards.A woman developed an abdominal wall abscess 1 week after having a cesarean section. The abscess was treated with systemic antibiotics and the wound was packed with 60 sq. cm of iodine tampons, containing about 10.5 mg of iodine. On day 29 postpartum, her milk iodine was 4410 mcg/L (normal range 29 to 490 mcg/L). Her iodine therapy was stopped, and 2 days later milk iodine was about 1400 mcg/L; by day 40 postpartum, it was about 1000 mcg/L. By day 60 postpartum, the milk level was below 100 mcg/L.[12] The mother of a 31-week preterm infant packed her cesarean section wound with iodine-soaked gauze because of wound dehiscence and infection. Her breastmilk iodine concentration at 3 weeks postpartum was 1911 mcg/L (upper limit of normal 185 mcg/L).[13] The mothers of 31 preterm Korean infants was measured for iodine concentration on week 1, 3 and 6 postpartum. Korean mothers have elevated iodine levels from large amounts of dietary iodine in brown seaweed soup during the first month postpartum. Median breastmilk iodine levels were 2529, 1153 and 822 mcg/L at the 3 times, respectively.[14] A mother used an iodine antiseptic on her episiotomy wound for 10 to 12 days postpartum. At 15 days postpartum, her milk iodine level was 300 mcg/L (normal 100-200 mcg/L).[15] A mother ate large amounts of seaweed soup imported from China for the first 10 days postpartum to increase her breastmilk supply. Breastmilk iodine levels were much higher during the time of seaweed consumption at 878 mcg/L total iodine compared to 188 mcg/L 4 weeks later and 144 mcg/L 7 weeks later.[16]A study in northern Spain compared the milk iodide level of mothers taking a normal diet, including iodized salt and seafood (n = 14), with mothers on the same diet plus a supplement of 200 mg daily of potassium iodide (n = 46). The median breastmilk iodide levels from supplemented mothers of preterm infants was 0.172 mg/L in the supplemented mothers compared to 0.128 mg/L in the unsupplemented mothers. The median breastmilk iodide levels from supplemented mothers of fullterm infants was 0.178 mg/L in the supplemented mothers compared to 0.117 mg/L in the unsupplemented mothers. No statistical difference was found between preterm and fullterm milk iodide in either the supplemented or unsupplemented group. The authors conclude that in this iodine-sufficient area, unsupplemented mothers excrete sufficient amounts of iodide in breastmilk.[17] Sixteen lactating women were administered 752 mcg of potassium iodide (572 mcg iodine) in the morning afer an overnight fast. They also ingested an additional 36 to 685 mcg of dietary iodine during the study period. Breastmilk samples were obtained at baseline and every hour for 8 hours. Breastmilk iodide increased from an average of 46 mcg/L at baseline to a peak of 354 mcg/L. Peak iodine levels in milk occurred at an median of 6 hours (range 5 to 7 hours) after the dose of iodine.[18]A study in Thailand compared mothers supplemented with 200 mcg daily of iodine daily to unsupplemented mothers. Breast milk samples were collected from 57 lactating women, 33 of whom received iodine supplementation during pregnancy. The median breastmilk iodine concentration at 2 months postpartum was significantly higher in the supplemented mothers (109 mcg/L) than in nonsupplemented mothers 70 mcg/L).[19] Infant Levels: The preterm infants of Korean mothers with high levels of breastmilk iodine had relative high urinary iodine levels that were thought to be related to high maternal intake of iodine.[14] A woman developed an abdominal wall abscess 1 week after having a cesarean section. The abscess was treated with systemic antibiotics and the wound was packed with 60 sq. cm of iodine tampons, containing about 10.5 mg of iodine. On day 29 postpartum, her breastfed infant's urine contained 3932 mcg/L of iodine (normal range   < 185 mcg/L). By day 40 postpartum, the infant's urine iodine level was normal.[12] The mother of a 31-week preterm infant packed her cesarean section wound with iodine-soaked gauze because of wound dehiscence and infection. The urine iodine level of her 2-week-old breastfed neonate was 684 mcg/L (normal range 42-350 mcg/L).[13] A mother used an iodine antiseptic on her episiotomy wound for 10 to 12 days postpartum. At 15 days of age, her infant had a urinary iodine concentration of 410 mcg/L (normal 100 to 200 mcg/L).[15]Two mothers originally from Asia (Korea and China) reportedly ate large amounts of soup made from seaweed from their home countries in the postpartum period. The infants of both mothers had elevated urinary iodine levels. The Korean mother continued to eat the soup for several weeks postpartum. Her infant's urinary iodine levels were 391  mcg/L and 690 mcg/L (normal range 100 to 300 mcg/L) at 1 and 2 months postpartum. The Chinese mother ate large quantities of seaweed soup for the first 10 days postpartum to increase her breastmilk supply. Her infant's urinary iodine level at 4 weeks of age was 343 mcg/L or 5055 mcg/gram of creatinine (normal range 100 to 300 mcg/gram).[16] A study of 46 nursing mothers supplemented with 200 mg of potassium iodide daily measured the iodine content of their breastfed infants' urine. Urine iodide concentrations were 0.365 mg/L among preterm infants and 0.376 mg/L among fullterm infants.[17] A study in Thailand compared mothers supplemented with 200 mcg daily of iodine daily during pregnancy to unsupplemented mothers. At 2 months of age, exclusively breast-fed infants whose mothers received iodine supplementation (n = 11) had greater urinary iodine concentrations (381 mcg/L) than those whose mothers were not supplemented (n = 14;  216 mcg/L).[19]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "In Switzerland, a girl born at 29 weeks of gestation with adequate size for gestational age showed negative TSH screening on day 5. Her mother developed an abscess of the abdominal wall 1 week after her cesarian section and the wound was packed with tampons containing about 10.5 mg of iodine. The baby's TSH was elevated to 23 milliunits/L on day 23, and 288 milliunits/L on day 29. Free thyroxine (T4) levels were decreased to 2.8 ng/L and free liothyronine (T3) with 1.52 ng/L, without signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism. Iodine contents of maternal milk and of infant urine were 4.4 mg/L and 3.9 mg/L, respectively. Treatment with levothyroxine was started, breastfeeding was discontinued and disinfection with iodine was stopped. The infant's thyroid function tests normalized after 6 days.[12] The infant's abnormal thyroid function tests were probably caused by maternal iodine use. The mother of a 31-week, 961 gram preterm infant packed her cesarean section wound with iodine-soaked gauze because of wound dehiscence and infection. She was expressing milk for her hospitalized infant. The infant's thyroid function tests were normal at birth, but at 2 weeks of age, the infant's serum thyroxine was borderline low and TSH levels were elevated. One week later, TSH had increased to 77 milliunits/L and both thyroxine and free thyroxine levels were low. Breastmilk was discontinued and levothyroxine was started. The mother discontinued the iodine packing and 1 week later breastmilk feeding was resumed. At 2 months of age, the infant's thyroid function test were normal while taking levothyroxine.[13]A study of 31 preterm infants born at 34 weeks gestational age or less was performed in Korea where mothers typically ingest large amounts of seaweed soup during the first month postpartum. Subclinical hypothyroidism was frequently found in the infants with high intake of iodine from breastmilk.[14] A mother used an iodine antiseptic on her episiotomy wound for 10 to 12 days postpartum. At 15 days of age, her infant had elevated TSH and low free T4 serum levels, an enlarged thyroid gland, and an elevated urinary iodine concentration. The infant's symptoms were probably related to maternal iodine application.[15] Two mothers originally from Asia (Korea and China) reportedly ate large amounts of soup made from seaweed from their home countries in the postpartum period. Their infants had elevated thyrotropin (TSH) levels when tested at 3 to 4 weeks of age and signs of hypothyroidism. Both were treated with thyroid hormones and regained normal thyroid function.[16] A 21-day-old breastfed (extent not stated) infant presented with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Neonatal TSH screening was normal, but at 21 days it was 87.3 IU/L (normal 0.27 to 4.2 IU/L). Free T4 was 7.3 pmol/L (normal 12 to 22 pmol/L) and the thyroid was slightly enlarged. The infant's parents were of Korean origin and the mother had consumed 3 to 4 bowls of brown seaweed (Undaria pinnatifidia) soup daily from the time of birth. The infant's hypotyroidism was probably caused by the high iodine content of the seaweed soup.[20]"

A mother taking carisoprodol 700 mg three times daily during pregnancy and lactation had trough breastmilk levels of carisoprodol and meprobamate measured before the first morning dose on 4 consecutive days at steady-state (time postpartum not stated). Average minimum breastmilk levels were 0.9 mg/L for carisoprodol and 11.6 mg/L for meprobamate. The authors calculated that the minimum infant dose of the drug plus metabolite was 1.9 mg/kg daily or 4.1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Extrapolating these results to an average (rather than minimum) dose, the authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 3 mg/kg daily or 6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[2] A woman who was suspected to have been abusing carisoprodol had the drug and meprobamate detectable in breastmilk for 2 consecutive days after hospitalization; only meprobamate was detectable on day 3.[3] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Intranasal oxytocin is reportedly used by some midwives in Switzerland as a galactogogue.[10] A small study found no difference in symptoms between subcutaneous oxytocin 2.5 international units daily and placebo after 3 days of treatment for breast engorgement.[11][12] An early randomized, placebo-controlled trial used oxytocin nasal spray in the mothers of newborns, but lactation management fell far short of what is considered acceptable nowadays. The study found that the spray might be useful in decreasing breast engorgement slightly in the mothers of fullterm infants, but no difference was found in the average infant weight loss between birth and day 4 in the oxytocin and placebo groups.[13] Two similarly designed trials studied oxytocin nasal spray in mothers of preterm newborns who were pumping milk for their infants. The first studied mothers of infants born before 38 weeks and used a total of 3 units of intranasal oxytocin (Syntocinon-Sandoz, 40 units/mL) before pumping each breast for10 minutes a breast pump four times daily. Among primiparous mothers, milk production during days 2 to 5 days postpartum was 1964 mL in those who used oxytocin and 510 mL in those who received placebo spray. Because of the large and statistically significant effect of oxytocin among primiparous women, the trial was stopped after only 8 primiparous mothers had been studied. No statistically significant difference was found between oxytocin and placebo among 4 multiparous women who were attempting to breastfeed for the first time. The paper did not report giving the mothers any instructions in lactation technique.[14] Fifty-one mothers who delivered an infant of less than 35 weeks gestation were studied. Twenty-seven mothers used 4 units of intranasal oxytocin (Syntocinon-Novartis, 40 units/mL), and 24 mothers received an identical placebo spray before pumping with a breast pump. All mothers were given instructions on using hand massage before pumping and advised to pump every 3 hours. No difference in milk production over the first 5 days postpartum was found between mothers who received oxytocin (median 667 mL) and placebo (median 530 mL), although women receiving oxytocin produced slightly more milk on day 2 of the study. Parity had no effect in this study.[15] Several factors might explain the differences in findings between the studies. Because of the great interpatient variability in milk production documented in the recent study and the small number of patients in the first study, the finding in the earlier study may have been due to chance. A 50% higher dose of oxytocin was used in the first study, which may have caused a greater effect. Another plausible explanation is the good lactation support given to mothers in the recent larger study that seemed to be lacking in the early study. Two case reports indicate that oxytocin nasal spray may facilitate letdown in tetraplegic women who have lost the neuronal connection between the nipple and the hypothalamus.[16] Logistic regress of data from 585 mothers who had epidural analgesia during labor found that mothers who had received exogenous oxytocin had a 3.3 times greater risk of delayed onset of lactation than women who did not.[6] An observational study of 20 primiparous women found that those who were exclusively breastfeeding at 3 months (63%) had received a lower dose of oxytocin during delivery (mean total dosage 1363 mIU) than those who were not exclusively breastfeeding (mean total dosage 3088 mIU). This result was attributed to an inhibitory effect on neonatal sucking by the infant caused by oxytocin.[1] A small, nonrandomized cohort study found that the newborn infants whose mothers received synthetic oxytocin to induce or maintain labor had a decreased level of prefeeding organization one hour after birth.[5] A retrospective cohort study in Spain compared breastfeeding outcomes between mothers who received oxytocin during labor (n = 189) and mothers who did not, including those who delivered via elective Cesarean section (n = 127). Mothers who received oxytocin during the first and second stages of labor had a 45% increased risk of bottle feeding and a 129% increased risk of breastfeeding discontinuation by 3 months of age. Effects were most pronounced in women under 27 years of age.[4]"

Oseltamivir milk concentrations fluctuated depending on the time of the milk sample, but oseltamivir carboxylate concentrations were generally higher and reached a steady-state between 37 to 39 mcg/L after 3 days of therapy. The authors calculated that at worst, the infant would receive 0.012 mg/kg daily, compared to the dosage for infants over 1 year of 4 mg/kg daily.

Many of the mothers in the placebo group, but none in the somatropin group, had decreases in production during the study.[5] The differences in baseline milk production between the 2 groups might have affected the response to somatropin and the study did not report the changes, if any, in the proportion of infant nutrition from breastmilk.

Several outcome parameters were measured: time to lactogenesis II, prevalence of lactation failure, use of formula supplementation and milk composition at 6 weeks postpartum. No differences were found in any of the outcomes between the two groups.[7] A prospective, nonrandomized trial compared 4 contraceptives in 10 women each to assess their effect on milk production. One of the following were begun on day 42 postpartum as chosen by the mother: combined ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg plus levonorgestrel 150 mcg (Microvlar), etonogestrel implant (Implanon), levonorgestrel intrauterine system (Myrena), or a copper IUD (Optima). Milk intake was measured using deuterium oxide given to the mother and measured in the infants' saliva as well as numbers of wet diapers per day.

The total dosage of ropivacaine was 50 to 124 mg and the average total infusion time from start to delivery was 219 minutes. The study found no differences between the groups in breastfeeding effectiveness or infant neurobehavioral status at 8 to 12 hours postpartum or the number exclusively or partially breastfeeding at 4 weeks postpartum.[2] A randomized, prospective study compared mothers who received epidural labor analgesia with ropivacaine (n = 75) to mothers who did not receive labor analgesia (n = 49). In the treatment group, 3 mL of ropivacaine 0.125% was injected epidurally, followed in some mothers by an additional 12 mL. In all treated mothers, 5 mL per hour was then given as a continuous epidural infusion. Although serum prolactin concentrations were somewhat lower in the group who received ropivacaine, no difference was seen between the groups in time of lactation onset, number of women with extensive lactation, and the decrease in infant weight reduction.[3] A nonrandomized study at one Italian hospital compared primaparous mothers undergoing vaginal delivery who received epidural analgesia (n = 64) to those who did not (n = 64). Mothers who requested the epidural analgesia received an initial dose of 100 mcg of fentanyl diluted to 10 mL with saline. After the initial fentanyl, doses of 15 to 20 mL of 0.1% ropivacaine were administered, if needed; however, the number of women who received ropivacaine was not reported. The only difference between the groups of mothers was a longer duration of labor among the treated mothers. The quality of infant nursing was equal between the 2 groups of infants on several measures; however, more infants in the treated group breastfed for less than 30 minutes at the first feeding.[4] A national survey of women and their infants from late pregnancy through 12 months postpartum compared the time of lactogenesis II in mothers who did and did not receive pain medication during labor. Categories of medication were spinal or epidural only, spinal or epidural plus another medication, and other pain medication only. Women who received medications from any of the categories had about twice the risk of having delayed lactogenesis II (  > 72 hours) compared to women who received no labor pain medication.[5] A nonrandomized convenience sample of women who did (n = 209) or did not (n = 157) receive epidural analgesia during labor was analyzed to determine whether epidurals affected the onset of lactation. Although not standardized, the typical procedure used sufentanil 10 to 15 mg together with either ropivacaine 0.1% or levobupivacaine 0.0625% epidurally, supplemented by epidural boluses of ropivacaine 0.1% or levobupivacaine 0.0625% about every 2 hours. No difference was found in the time of lactation onset between the two groups. Although women in both groups stated they wished to breastfeed prior to delivery, exclusive breastfeeding at 20 days postpartum was less frequent in the women who received an epidural (43%) than in women who did not (57%).[6]"

Both dosages of clomiphene were superior to placebo as reported by the women, but the 100 mg daily dosage was somewhat superior to the 50 mg daily dosage.[1] A study compared clomiphene 100 mg daily for 5 days (n = 60) to placebo (n = 30) in suppressing lactation and symptoms of engorgement. Starting clomiphene within 12 hours of delivery was more effective in all measures than starting it 12 hours or more after delivery as judged by a physician observer; both treatments were more effective than mechanical measures alone such as breast binding.[2] A randomized trial compared clomiphene 50 mg twice daily for 14 days (n = 15) to bromocriptine 2.5 mg twice daily for 14 days (n = 15), diethylstilbestrol 5 mg 3 times daily for 14 days (n = 15), testosterone proprionate 75 mg intramuscularly once (n = 15), and placebo 3 times daily by mouth (n = 15) in their ability to reduce serum prolactin and lactation postpartum. After three days of treatment, serum prolactin was reduced to 65% of baseline by clomiphene compared to a drop to 35% in patients who received bromocriptine. Clomiphene was also less effective than bromocriptine in suppressing lactation and symptoms of engorgement.[3] A study compared clomiphene 100 mg daily for 7 days (n = 10) to placebo (n = 12) started on the first day postpartum. Clomiphene was no more effective than placebo in suppressing lactation or reducing serum prolactin concentrations.[4] Women in the first week postpartum who did not wish to breastfeed received either clomiphene 50 mg twice daily (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10). Women who received clomiphene did not experience a rise in serum prolactin from baseline values during use of a breast pump; those given placebo had the normal post-stimulation rise in serum prolactin.[5] Eighty postpartum women were studied. Forty received clomiphene 50 mg twice daily for 5 days beginning the first day postpartum; 20 received clomiphene 50 mg twice daily for 5 days beginning the fourth day postpartum; and, 20 received placebo. All women receiving clomiphene experienced inhibition of lactation, and reductions in breast engorgement, discomfort and serum prolactin. Prolactin serum concentrations became statistically lower than baseline on day 3 for the women who were 1 day postpartum and on day 5 for those who were 4 days postpartum at the outset.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Dipyrone is not approved for marketing in the United States by the US Food and Drug Administration or in Canada and many European countries because of its adverse reactions, including agranulocytosis. However, it is widely used in other countries during labor and breastfeeding.[1][2][3][4] After ingestion by the mother, dipyrone and its metabolites appear in breastmilk in rather large amounts. It is found in the blood and urine of breastfed infants and can cause pharmacological effects in the breastfed infant. One case of cyanotic episodes in a breastfed infant was attributed to dipyrone in breastmilk. The drug and metabolites are eliminated from the breastmilk by 48 hours after a dose and one manufacturer recommends no breastfeeding for 48 hours after a dose.[5] Safer alternatives are available for analgesia during breastfeeding."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A woman took 3 doses of dipyrone 500 mg orally, over a 16-hour period. The dipyrone concentration in breastmilk was 4.3 mg/L 24 hours after the last dose.[6] Ten women who were 3 to 5 days postpartum were given a single dose of 1 gram of dipyrone orally. Milk concentrations of its four metabolites were measured in breastmilk. In 8 of the patients, milk samples were taken once between 2.5 to 5.5 hours after the dose; all 4 metabolites were detected in the milk of all mothers. The total concentration of all the metabolites averaged 20.5 mg/L at the times sampled. In 2 of the women, milk samples were obtained before drug administration and before each feeding for 3 days. By 48 hours after the dose all metabolites were absent from breastmilk.[7] Using data from the 2 mothers with extensive sampling, an exclusively breastfed infant would receive an average of 6.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dipyrone dosage in the form of metabolites. In a survey of breastmilk in a rural Chilean hospital, dipyrone was detectable in the breastmilk of 8 out of 15 mothers tested.[1] Infant Levels: Dipyrone was detected in a breastfed infant's serum and urine after his mother took 1500 mg of dipyrone over a 16-hour period. The infant's dipyrone serum concentration was 3.2 mg/L and urine concentration was 3.74 mg/L.[6]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A 42-day-old breastfed infant had 2 cyanotic episodes within 30 minutes after his mother took 3 doses of dipyrone 500 mg orally, 18, 7 and 2 hours before the first episode. A third episode occurred 24 hours after admission to the hospital. Dipyrone was detected in the mother's breastmilk 24 hours after the last dose and in the infant's serum and urine. No explanation could be found for the cyanotic episodes other than dipyrone and after suspending maternal dipyrone intake, no further episodes occurred in the infant up to age 3 years. The reaction is rated as possibly caused by dipyrone in breastmilk.[6] In a blinded study, mothers who were at least 3 days postpartum and requesting analgesia for postpartum uterine pain were given either 1 gram of dipyrone or placebo. The infants of mothers who received dipyrone cried fewer times and for shorter durations in the 14 hours after drug administration than the infants of mothers who received placebo. This effect was more apparent in infants who demand fed than in those who fed on a fixed schedule.[8] Although this study appears to demonstrate a pharmacologic effect in the infants from dipyrone in milk, there is no clear explanation for the change in infant behavior. A multicenter case-control study in Brazil compared 231 children who developed leukemia before 2 years of age with 411 children with various other nonmalignant diseases. Mothers were interviewed to ascertain their analgesic use during pregnancy and lactation. Nursing mothers who took dipyrone during the three months after delivery had a 2-fold risk of having a child with acute lymphocytic leukemia and a 3.87-fold risk in having rearrangement of the MLL gene in infants under one year of age.[9]"

Skimmed breastmilk efavirenz concentrations averaged 3.5 mg/L (range 1.3 to 7.4 mg/L).[3] Five mothers who were taking oral efavirenz 600 mg daily as part of an antiretroviral regimen collected mid-feed milk samples at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after an evening dose at an average of 146 days after delivery. The average peak level of 4.5 mg/L occurred at about 4 hours after the dose and the average trough milk value was 2.5 mg/L.[4] One hundred thirty-four mothers who were taking efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime as part of their antiretroviral regimen and their infants were studied. In the first part of the study, women were separated into noncarriers, homozygotes and homozygotes for the CYP2B6 516TT gene. Random breastmilk concentrations had median values of 1610, 2370 and 4070 mcg/L in the three groups, respectively. A subset of mothers underwent extensive sampling of plasma and breastmilk sampling. In these mothers the median peak breastmilk levels were 4020 4540 and 8920 mcg/L, respectively. Corresponding trough milk levels were 1120, 1500, and 2480 mcg/L. The authors estimated that the average dosages that infants would receive would be 344 mcg/kg, 379 mcg/kg and 1340 mcg/kg daily in the maternal noncarrier, heterozygous and homozygous groups, respectively.[5] Infant Levels: Thirteen mothers who averaged 15.8 weeks (range 6 to 25 weeks) postpartum were treated with efavirenz 600 mg daily plus lamivudine and zidovudine (n = 12) or stavudine (n = 1). Plasma samples were taken from their breastfed infants 3 to 4 hours after the last dose. Infant plasma concentrations averaged 0.86 mg/L (range 0.4 to 1.5 mg/L). Infant plasma concentrations averaged 13% of maternal plasma concentrations, but there was no statistically significant correlation between them. Average plasma levels were slightly below the plasma level considered effective for suppression of HIV in adults.[3] Efavirenz was measured in 117 breastfed (90% exclusive) infants whose mothers were taking efavirenz for HIV infection during pregnancy and postpartum. All infants had detectable efavirenz in their plasma samples at 0 (mean 1.7 mg/L), 8 (mean 0.3 mg/L) and 12 (mean 0.3 mg/L) weeks postpartum. All infants had detectable efavirenz in their hair samples at 12 weeks postpartum at a mean concentration of 1.9 mcg/gram of hair (range 0.34 to 11 mcg/gram). The authors interpreted the results to mean that infants receive substantial exposure to efavirenz during breastfeeding.[6] One hundred thirty-four mothers who were taking efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime as part of their antiretroviral regimen and their infants were studied. In the first part of the study, women were separated into noncarriers, homozygotes and homozygotes for the CYP2B6 516TT gene. Random infant serum concentrations had median values of 124, 164, and 333 mcg/L in the three groups, respectively. A subset of mothers and infants underwent extensive sampling of plasma and breastmilk sampling. In these infants, median plasma levels were 166, 89 and 293 mcg/L at 2 hours after the maternal dose and 134, 86 and 342 mcg/L at 8 hours after the maternal dose, respectively.[5]"

All mothers received lamivudine 150 mg, zidovudine 300 mg twice daily and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole once daily. All infants received prophylaxis with either zidovudine for 1 week or nevirapine for 6 weeks, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole from 6 weeks of age to 6 weeks after weaning.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Milk samples were taken daily before breastfeeding from women receiving lamivudine from 2 groups of women. In the group (n = 10) receiving lamivudine 300 mg twice daily (n = 10), the average milk concentration was 1.2 mg/L (range   < 0.5 to 6.1 mg/L). In the group receiving 150 mg twice daily plus zidovudine (n = 10), the average milk lamivudine concentration was 0.9 mg/L (range   < 0.5 to 8.2 mg/L).[4] Twenty women who were receiving oral lamivudine 150 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen had their milk analyzed at either 2 or 5 months postpartum. Milk samples were provided at a median of 4 hours (range 1 to 8.5 hours) after the last dose. The median lamivudine concentration in breastmilk was 1.8 mg/L.[5] Forty women were given postpartum prophylaxis with unstated dosages of lamivudine, nevirapine, and zidovudine (or stavudine if the hemoglobin   < 8 g/dL). Blood and milk samples were collected once during the first 3 days postpartum and once at 7 days postpartum. The median times after a dose that samples were collected were 5.3 hours (range 0 to 99 hours) for the first sample and 6 hours (range 4.3 to 20 hours) for the 7-day sample. Average breastmilk lamivudine concentrations were calculated only for samples that had detectable (  > 20 mcg/L) concentrations of nevirapine. The mean breastmilk concentrations were 0.4 (n = 20) and 0.4 mg/L (n = 30), respectively, at the two sampling times, which was 2.9 to 3.3 times the simultaneous maternal serum concentrations.[6] Forty-seven samples of breastmilk and maternal serum were obtained at 6, 12 and 24 weeks postpartum from mothers taking lamivudine as part of a combination of antiretrovirals. The lamivudine dosage the mothers were taking was not stated in the abstract. The median breastmilk concentrations of lamivudine at a median of 14 hours after the last maternal dose were 510 (17 samples), 387 (17 samples) and 310 mcg/L (13 samples). Median milk concentrations were 2.6 times (interquartile range 1.1 to 3.5 times) the maternal plasma concentrations.[7] In a related study by the same authors, the lamivudine milk to plasma ratio was found to be 2.96 in 49 patients.[8] Fifty-eight mothers who were taking a combination regimen of lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine had their serum and breastmilk analyzed for the presence of these drugs. Mothers took lamivudine 150 mg twice daily starting at 34 to 36 weeks postpartum and continuing until 6 months postpartum. Breastmilk was collected within 24 hours after delivery and at 2, 6, 14 and 24 weeks postpartum at variable times after the previous dose. The median breastmilk lamivudine concentration across all visits was 1214 mcg/L. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive a daily dosage of 182 mcg/kg of lamivudine.[9] Sixty-six mothers who were receiving lamivudine 150 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen provided a total of 206 milk samples at birth, 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum. Milk samples were collected at a median of 4.5 hours (range 3.5 to 6 hours) after the previous dose. The median breastmilk lamivudine concentration was 446 mcg/L (range 269 to 683 mcg/L).[10] In a continuation of the same study, 65 breastmilk samples obtained at 1, 3 and 6 months postpartum were analyzed for lamivudine after the same dose. The median concentration was 684 mcg/L (IRQ range 405 to 868 mcg/L). It is not clear if the latter study included some of the same patients as the first study.[11] Fifteen women had been taking lamivudine 150 mg twice daily for 53 to 182 days as part of a drug combination that included either abacavir and zidovudine or lopinavir, ritonavir, and zidovudine. Breastmilk samples were collected at just before a dose at a median of 1 month postpartum. Whole breastmilk levels contained a median of 0.14 mg/L of lamivudine, which was a median of 74% of maternal blood levels.[12] Thirty women were studied at 6, 12 or 24 weeks postpartum (10 at each time). Each mother was taking zidovudine 300 mg, lamivudine 150 mg, lopinavir 400 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily by mouth starting at delivery. On the study day, at a median of 14.9 hours after the previous evening's dose, maternal plasma and breastmilk samples were obtained prior to the morning dose and 2, 4 and 6 hours after the dose. One hundred seven of the 121 breastmilk samples contained detectable quantities (10 mcg/L or greater) of lamivudine, with an median breastmilk concentration of 0.94 mg/L over the 6 hours.[13] Infant Levels: Twenty nursing mothers were receiving oral lamivudine 150 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen. Their infants had serum concentrations determined at either 2 or 5 months postpartum. Serum samples were provided at a median of 4 hours (range 1 to 8.5 hours) after the last dose. The median infant serum lamivudine concentration was 28 mcg/L (range   < 14 to 53 mcg/L). The average value was 5% of the IC50 for HIV.[5] The infants of postpartum mothers taking nevirapine as part of a combination of antiretrovirals had undetectable serum nevirapine concentrations by HPLC/MS analysis. The lamivudine dosage the mothers were taking and times of infant plasma sampling were not stated in the abstract. Infant serum concentrations were measured at 6 (17 samples), 12 (17 samples), and 24 (13 samples) weeks of age at an average of 14 hours after the last maternal dose. Median infant serum lamivudine concentrations were 13, 10, and 5 mcg/L, respectively, which was 6% of the maternal serum concentration.[7] Fifty-eight infants whose mothers were taking a combination regimen of lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine had their serum analyzed for the presence of these drugs. Mothers took lamivudine 150 mg twice daily starting at 34 to 36 weeks postpartum and continuing until 6 months postpartum and were instructed to exclusively breastfeed for 5.5 months. Serum samples were collected within 24 hours after delivery and at 2, 6, 14 and 24 weeks postpartum. The median infant dried blood spot lamivudine concentrations were 67 mcg/L at delivery, 32 mcg/L at week 2, 24 mcg/L at week 6, 20 mcg/L at week 14 and not measurable (  < 16 mcg/L) at week 24 postpartum.[9] Breastfed infants of 66 mothers who were receiving lamivudine 150 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen had a total of 64 blood samples analyzed at 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum. Samples were collected at a median of 4.5 hours (range 3.5 to 6 hours) after the previous maternal dose and a median of 30 minutes (range 20 to 60 minutes) after the previous nursing. The medial infants' lamivudine plasma concentration was 18 mcg/L (range 7 to 35 mcg/L), which was a median of 2% (range 0 to 4%) of the maternal serum concentration.[10] In a continuation of the same study, 17 breastfed infants (extent not stated) donated 22 blood samples between 1 and 6 months for lamivudine analysis. Their mothers were taking lamivudine 150 mg twice daily as part of combination antiretroviral regimens. The median concentration was 29.2 mcg/L (IRQ range 12.2 to 58.7 mcg/L). It is not clear if the latter study included some of the same patients as the first study.[11] Twenty-four infants were breastfed either partially or exclusively by their mothers who had been taking lamivudine 150 mg twice daily for 53 to 182 days as part of a drug combination that included either abacavir and zidovudine or lopinavir, ritonavir, and zidovudine. Infant blood was collected at a median of 1 month postpartum at 11 to 18 hours after the last dose and a median of 1 hour (range 6 minutes to 35 hours) after the last breastfeeding. All of the infant plasma samples had undetectable (  < 7 mcg/L) plasma levels of lamivudine.[12] Thirty nursing mothers were studied at 6, 12 or 24 weeks postpartum (10 at each time). Each mother was taking lamivudine 150 mg twice daily by mouth starting at delivery. Infant plasma samples were obtained before their mother's first dose and at 2, 4 and 6 hours after the mother's dose. Infants were allowed to breastfeed ad libitum during the study period. Lamivudine was detectable (10 mcg/L or greater) in 107 of the 115 infant plasma samples, at a median concentration of 180 mcg/L.[13]"

A higher percentage of infants in the HAART-exposed group had neutropenia than those in the unexposed group at 1 month of age (15.9% and 3.7%, respectively). Hematologic toxicity was transient and asymptomatic. From 2 to 6 months postpartum, no differences in hematologic toxicity were seen between breastfed and formula-fed infants.

The dosages, dosage regimens and time of breastmilk sample collection times were not reported. Lopinavir was not detected in any of 60 breastmilk samples.[3] Nine mothers who were receiving lopinavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen provided a total of 23 milk samples at birth, 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum.

The median breastmilk lopinavir concentration was 1834 mcg/L (range 557 to 3950 mcg/L).[4] Fifteen women had been taking lopinavir 400 mg twice daily for 53 to 182 days as part of a drug combination that included ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. Breastmilk samples were collected at just before a dose at a median of 1 month postpartum. Whole breastmilk levels contained a median of 0.06 mg/L of lopinavir, which was a median of 0.7% of maternal blood levels.[5] Thirty women were studied at 6, 12 or 24 weeks postpartum (10 at each time).

One hundred seventeen of the 121 breastmilk samples contained detectable quantities (10 mcg/L or greater) of lopinavir, with a median breastmilk concentration of 1.43 mg/L over the 6 hours.[6] Infant Levels: Breastfed infants of 9 mothers who were receiving lopinavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen had a total of 6 blood samples analyzed at 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum. Samples were collected at a median of 4.5 hours (range 3.5 to 6 hours) after the previous maternal dose and a median of 30 minutes (range 20 to 60 minutes) after the previous nursing. The infants' median lopinavir plasma concentrations was 105 mcg/L (range 12 to 518 mcg/L), which was a median of 8% (range 0 to 16%) of the maternal serum concentration.[4] Five infants were breastfed either partially or exclusively by their mothers who had been taking lopinavir 400 mg twice daily for 53 to 182 days as part of a drug combination that included ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. Infant blood was collected at a median of 1 month postpartum at 11 to 16 hours after the last dose and a median of 1 hour (range 6 minutes to 35 hours) after the last breastfeeding. Two of five infants had measurable lopinavir plasma levels of   < 1 mg/L.[5] Lopinavir was measured in 117 breastfed (90% exclusive) infants whose mothers were taking lopinavir plus ritonavir for HIV infection during pregnancy and postpartum. At 8 weeks postpartum, only 2% had detectable lopinavir in their plasma at a mean concentration of 0.17 mg/L. At 12 weeks postpartum, none of the infants had detectable lopinavir in their plasma, and 96% of infants had detectable lopinavir in their hair samples at a mean concentration of 5.1 ng/mg of hair (range 0.13 to 15.8 ng/mg). The authors interpreted the results to mean that infants receive negligible exposure to lopinavir during breastfeeding.[7] Thirty nursing mothers were studied at 6, 12 or 24 weeks postpartum (10 at each time). Each mother was taking lopinavir 400 mg twice daily by mouth starting at delivery. Infant plasma samples were obtained before their mother's first dose and at 2, 4 and 6 hours after the mother's dose. Infants were allowed to breastfeed ad libitum during the study period.

Formula-fed infants had the lowest rate of severe anemia (2.5%). The anemia generally responded well to iron and multivitamin supplementation, and discontinuation of zidovudine.[8] An unblinded study in Uganda compared the outcomes of breastfed infants and their HIV-positive mothers who were randomized to receive antiretrovial therapy that was based either on efavirenz 600 mg once daily or lopinavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily during breastfeeding. All mothers received lamivudine 150 mg, zidovudine 300 mg twice daily and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole once daily. All infants received prophylaxis with either zidovudine for 1 week or nevirapine for 6 weeks, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole from 6 weeks of age to 6 weeks after weaning.

Median breastmilk nelfinavir concentrations were 83 mcg/L at birth, 358 mcg/L at 2 weeks, 286 mcg/L at 6 weeks, 233 mcg/L at 14 weeks and 180 mcg/L at 24 weeks postpartum. The M8 metabolite was undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) in most samples; the highest concentrations found at any time was 32 mcg/L. Nelfinavir levels in breastmilk tended to drop during the dosing interval but M8 levels were relatively stable.[6] Infant Levels: The infants of postpartum mothers taking nelfinavir as part of a combination of antiretrovirals had undetectable serum nelfinavir concentrations by HPLC/MS analysis. The nelfinavir dosage the mothers were taking and times of infant plasma sampling were not stated in the abstract. Nelfinavir was not detectable in infant plasma at 6, 12 or 24 weeks of age.[4] Twenty-six breastfeeding Kenyan mothers were receiving oral nelfinavir 1.25 grams twice daily in addition to zidovudine and lamivudine for HIV infection. Infant blood samples were obtained at various times between 2 and 24 weeks postpartum. Nelfinavir and M8 concentration were undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) for 20 of the 28 infant blood samples. The highest concentrations detected were 30 mcg/L for nelfinavir and 32 mcg/L for M8 which are less than the MIC for the HIV virus.[6]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A study compared the frequency of rash, hepatotoxicity, and hyperbilirubinemia among 464 breastfed infants whose mothers were taking either A study compared the frequency of rash, hepatotoxicity, and hyperbilirubinemia among 464 breastfed infants whose mothers were taking either nelfinavir (n = 206) or nevirapine (n = 258) along with zidovudine and lamivudine for HIV infection during pregnancy and postpartum. Infants were examined during the first, second and sixth weeks postpartum. Moderate rash occurred in 7 (2.7%) of the infant exposed to nevirapine and one (0.5%) infant exposed to nelfinavir. Rash occurred at a median of 2 weeks postpartum. Four infants (1.9%) exposed to nelfinavir developed hepatotoxicity (3 moderate and 1 severe) and none exposed to nevirapine. Twenty-one infants (4.5%) developed high-risk hyperbilirubinemia, all prior to 48 hours of age, but there was no difference in exposure between the two drugs.[7]"

Gynecomastia is unilateral initially, but progresses to bilateral in about half of cases. No alterations in serum prolactin were noted and spontaneous resolution usually occurred within one year, even with continuation of the regimen.[8][9][10] Some case reports and in vitro studies have suggested that protease inhibitors might cause hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea in some male patients,[11][12] although this has been disputed.[13] The relevance of these findings to nursing mothers is not known. The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "In the United States and other developed countries, HIV-infected mothers should generally not breastfeed their infants. Nevirapine has been well studied in nursing mothers. In countries in which no acceptable, feasible, sustainable and safe replacement feeding is available, World Health Organization guidelines recommend that all women with an HIV infection who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be maintained on antiretroviral therapy for at least the duration of risk for mother-to-child transmission. Mothers should exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first 6 months of life; breastfeeding with complementary feeding should continue through 12 months of life. The first choice regimen for nursing mothers is tenofovir, efavirenz and either lamivudine or emtricitabine. If these drugs are unavailable, alternative regimens include: 1) zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz; 2) zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine; or 3) tenofovir, nevirapine and either lamivudine or emtricitabine. Exclusively breastfed infants should also receive 6 weeks of prophylaxis with nevirapine.[1][2] Because of the long half-life of nevirapine, subtherapeutic nevirapine concentrations can persist in breastmilk and infant serum for relatively long periods, potentially increasing the risk of development of nevirapine-resistant HIV infections when it is used alone for prophylaxis in the mother.[3][4][5][6][7][8]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Four breastmilk samples were obtained from 3 mothers who were taking nevirapine either 100 mg or 200 mg daily. Milk concentrations averaged 76% (range 54 to 104%) of maternal serum concentrations.[9] Twenty-one women received a single 200 mg oral dose of nevirapine during labor. Milk samples were collected 48, 72 and 168 hours after the dose. Breastmilk concentration of nevirapine were 454 mcg/L (range 219 to 972 mcg/L) at 48 hours postpartum and declined to 103 mcg/L (range 25 to 309 mcg/L) at 7 days postpartum. Milk levels declined in parallel with the maternal serum concentration with a half-life averaging 61 hours.[10] Three women were receiving nevirapine 200 mg twice daily as part of a highly active antiretroviral combination regimen. During the first 5 days postpartum milk was collected just before and 2 hours after the dose of nevirapine. Breastmilk nevirapine concentrations from milk samples ranged between 68 and 90% of the maternal serum concentration. Further details on the timing, or actual breastmilk concentrations were not provided.[11] Twenty women who were receiving oral nevirapine 200 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen had their milk analyzed at either 2 or 5 months postpartum. Milk samples were provided at a median of 4 hours (range 1 to 8.5 hours) after the last dose. The median nevirapine concentration in breastmilk was 6.8 mg/L.[12] Forty women were given postpartum prophylaxis with unstated dosages of lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine (or stavudine if the hemoglobin   < 8 g/dL). Blood and milk samples were collected once during the first 3 days postpartum and once at 7 days postpartum. The median times after a dose that samples were collected were 5.3 hours (range 0 to 99 hours) for the first sample and 6 hours (range 4.3 to 20 hours) for the 7-day sample. Average breastmilk nevirapine concentrations were calculated only for samples that had detectable (  > 50 mcg/L) concentrations of nevirapine. The mean breastmilk concentrations were 2.3 (n = 34) and 2.2 mg/L (n = 36), respectively, at the two sampling times, which was 60 to 80% of the simultaneous maternal serum concentrations.[13] Free and total breastmilk nevirapine concentrations were measured in one woman for 22 days after her last dose of nevirapine 200 mg which was given as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The peak whole milk concentration was 2.7 mg/L. Nevirapine was detectable in whole breastmilk for up to 17 days after the dose with an average (of left and right breasts) concentration of 13 mcg/L at that time. The average half-life was 70.6 hours. The peak unbound milk concentration was 1.5 mg/L. Nevirapine was detectable in whole breastmilk for up to 13 days after the dose with an average (of left and right breasts) concentration of 15.5 mcg/L at that time. The average half-life was 58 hours.[14] Twenty-one samples of breastmilk and maternal serum were obtained at 6, 12 and 24 weeks postpartum from mothers taking nevirapine as part of a combination of antiretrovirals. The nevirapine dosage the mothers were taking was not stated in the abstract. The median breastmilk concentrations of nevirapine were 1.3 mg/L at a median of 15 hours after the last dose at 6 weeks postpartum (8 samples), 3.4 mg/L at a median of 13 hours after the last dose at 12 weeks postpartum (7 samples), and 1.2 mg/L at a median of 12 hours after the last dose at 24 weeks postpartum (6 samples). Median milk concentrations were 12% (interquartile range 0 to 30%) of maternal plasma concentrations.[15] In a related study by the same authors, the nevirapine milk to plasma ratio was found to be 0.82 in 39 patients.[16] Fifty-eight mothers who were taking a combination regimen of lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine had their serum and breastmilk analyzed for the presence of these drugs. Mothers took nevirapine 200 mg daily for 14 days, then 200 mg twice daily starting at 34 to 36 weeks postpartum and continuing until 6 months postpartum. Breastmilk was collected within 24 hours after delivery and at 2, 6, 14 and 24 weeks postpartum at variable times after the previous dose. The median breastmilk lamivudine concentration across all visits was 4546 mcg/L. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive a daily dosage of 682 mcg/kg of nevirapine.[17] Sixty-two women received a single 200 mg dose of nevirapine at a median time of 5.2 hours before delivery. Breastmilk was obtained from each breast at delivery and 1, 2, and 6 weeks after the dose. A total of 116 breastmilk samples were obtained and analyzed. At delivery, the median breastmilk nevirapine concentration was 1012 mcg/L (interquartile range [IQR] 657 to 1364 mcg/L). At 1 week postpartum, breastmilk nevirapine had a median concentration of 164 mcg/L (IQR 75 to 213 mcg/L); breastmilk obtained 13 to 16 days postpartum had a median nevirapine concentration of 17 mcg/L (IQR 15 to 35 mcg/L). Nevirapine was undetectable (  < 15 mcg/L) in breastmilk at 6 weeks postpartum. Maternal plasma and breastmilk nevirapine concentrations fell with a half-life of 50.3 hours. A pharmacokinetic simulation indicated that breastmilk nevirapine concentrations fell below the IC50 for HIV at a median of 17 days (range 11.25 to 25.8 days) postpartum.[4] Ten women received a single oral dose of nevirapine 200 mg at delivery, followed by either 1 week of zidovudine pus lamivudine (Combivir) or a single dose of emtricitabine and tenofovir (Truvada). At one week postpartum, their median milk concentration of nevirapine was 290 mg/L (range 110 to 900 mg/L).[4] Milk samples were analyzed for nevirapine after mothers took a single 200 mg dose of nevirapine at the onset of labor. Of 51 mothers' milk samples, 47 had detectable nevirapine one week after taking the dose, with a median concentration of 112 mcg/L. At 2 weeks after the dose, the median concentration was 15 mcg/L in 40 milk samples assayed. At 4 weeks, nevirapine was undetectable (  < 10 mcg/L) in all 43 samples assayed.[18] Fifty-seven mothers who were receiving nevirapine 200 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen provided a total of 181 milk samples at birth, 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum. Milk samples were collected at a median of 4.5 hours (range 3.5 to 6 hours) after the previous dose. The median breastmilk nevirapine concentration was 2901 mcg/L (range 2097 to 4684 mcg/L).[19] Fifteen women had been taking nevirapine 200 mg twice daily as part of one of three drug combinations. Breastmilk samples were collected at just before a dose at a median of 1 month postpartum. Whole breastmilk levels contained a median of 1.83 mg/L of nevirapine, which was a median of 27% of maternal blood levels.[20] From a study of 224 women who received a single dose of nevirapine 200 mg at delivery, 1212 breastmilk samples were obtained at either 1 week and/or 4 weeks postpartum. At 1 week postpartum, nevirapine was detectable in 98% of women with median concentration of 0.22 mg/L. At 4 weeks, nevirapine was not detectable in breastmilk.[21] Five HIV-positive nursing mothers taking nevirapine 200 mg every 12 hours provided breastmilk samples 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after a dose. Mean peak and trough nevirapine concentrations in breastmilk were 5.2 mg/L and 4.3 mg/L, respectively. The trough values occurred at 0.5 hours after the dose and peak values occurred at 4 hours after the dose.[22] Infant Levels. Twenty nursing mothers were receiving oral nevirapine 200 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen. Their infants had serum concentrations determined at either 2 or 5 months postpartum. Serum samples were provided at a median of 4 hours (range 1 to 8.5 hours) after the last dose. The median infant serum nevirapine concentration was 971 mcg/L (range   < 16 to 2191 mcg/L). The average value was 40 times the IC50 for HIV.[12] The infants of postpartum mothers taking nevirapine as part of a combination of antiretrovirals had undetectable serum nevirapine concentrations by HPLC/MS analysis. The nevirapine dosage the mothers were taking and times of infant plasma sampling were not stated in the abstract. Infant serum concentrations were measured at 6 (8 samples), 12 (7 samples), and 24 (6 samples) weeks of age at averages of 15, 13 and 12 hours after the last maternal dose. Median infant serum nevirapine concentrations were 584, 607 and 233 mcg/L, respectively, which was 12% of the maternal serum concentration.[15] Fifty-eight infants whose mothers were taking a combination regimen of lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine had their serum analyzed for the presence of these drugs. Mothers took nevirapine 150 mg twice daily starting at 34 to 36 weeks postpartum and continuing until 6 months postpartum and were instructed to exclusively breastfeed for 5.5 months. Serum samples were collected within 24 hours after delivery and at 2, 6, 14 and 24 weeks postpartum. The median infant dried blood spot nevirapine concentrations were 2963 mcg/L at delivery, 987 mcg/L at week 2, 1032 mcg/L at week 6, 734 mcg/L at week 14 and 303 mcg/L at week 24 postpartum.[17] Breastfed infants of 58 mothers who were receiving nevirapine 200 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen had a total of 58 blood samples analyzed at 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum. Samples were collected at a median of 4.5 hours (range 3.5 to 6 hours) after the previous maternal dose and a median of 30 minutes (range 20 to 60 minutes) after the previous nursing. The infants' median nevirapine plasma concentration was 809 mcg/L (range 535 to 1061 mcg/L, which was a median of 18% (range 14 to 24%) of the maternal serum concentration.[19] Nine infants were breastfed either partially or exclusively by their mothers who had been taking nevirapine 200 mg twice daily as part of a drug combination that included zidovudine and lamivudine. Infant blood was collected at a median of 1 month postpartum at 12 to 17 hours after the last dose and a median of 1 hour (range 6 minutes to 35 hours) after the last breastfeeding. All nine infants had detectable nevirapine levels in their serum, with a median concentration of 0.37 mg/L (range 0.24 to 1.2 mg/L).[20] Four HIV-positive nursing mothers were taking nevirapine 200 mg every 12 hours. Their breastfed infants had serum nevirapine concentrations of 529 mcg/L and 556 mcg/L, at 2 and 8 h after the maternal dose, respectively.[22]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A study assigned pregnant women to zidovudine alone or highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART: zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine) to prevent maternal-to-child transmission of HIV infection. After delivery, All infants received one month of zidovudine prophylaxis; some infants were breastfed and others were formula fed. A higher percentage of infants in the HAART-exposed group had neutropenia than those in the unexposed group at 1 month of age (15.9 and 3.7%, respectively). Hematologic toxicity was transient and asymptomatic. From 2 to 6 months postpartum, no differences in hematologic toxicity were seen between breastfed and formula-fed infants. No statistical difference in hepatic toxicity was seen between the breastfed and formula-fed infants.[23] A study compared the breastfed infants of women who received a HAART regimen with nevirapine (n = 270) to one that contained nelfinavir (n = 206) as an alternative. Both regimens also contained zidovudine and lamivudine. Moderate rash was slightly more prevalent in infants who received nevirapine than nelfinavir via breastmilk. No differences were found in the rates of severe rash, liver toxicity or hyperbilirubinemia.[24] A study compared the frequency of rash, hepatotoxicity, and hyperbilirubinemia among 464 breastfed infants whose mothers were taking either nevirapine (n = 258) or nelfinavir (n = 206) along with zidovudine and lamivudine for HIV infection during pregnancy and postpartum.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: One study measured ritonavir in breastmilk samples from nursing mothers who had been randomized to receive the drug as part of a clinical trial to evaluate maternal to child transmission of HIV infection. The dosages, dosage regimens and time of breastmilk sample collection times were not reported. Ritonavir was not detected in any of 60 breastmilk samples.[3] Nine mothers who were receiving lopinavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen provided a total of 23 milk samples at birth, 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum. Milk samples were collected at a median of 4.5 hours (range 3.5 to 6 hours) after the previous dose. The median breastmilk ritonavir concentration was 79 mcg/L (range 31 to 193 mcg/L).[4] Thirty women were studied at 6, 12 or 24 weeks postpartum (10 at each time). Each mother was taking zidovudine 300 mg, lamivudine 150 mg, lopinavir 400 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily by mouth starting at delivery. On the study day, at a median of 14.9 hours after the previous evening's dose, maternal plasma and breastmilk samples were obtained prior to the morning dose and 2, 4 and 6 hours after the dose. One hundred twelve of the 121 breastmilk samples contained detectable quantities (10 mcg/L or greater) of ritonavir, with a median breastmilk concentration of 79 mcg/L over the 6 hours.[5] Infant Levels: Breastfed infants of 9 mothers who were receiving lopinavir 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen had a total of 6 blood samples analyzed at 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum. Samples were collected at a median of 4.5 hours (range 3.5 to 6 hours) after the previous maternal dose and a median of 30 minutes (range 20 to 60 minutes) after the previous nursing. The infants' median ritonavir plasma concentrations was 7 mcg/L (range 0 to 138 mcg/L), which was a median of 12% (range 11 to 40%) of the maternal serum concentration.[4] Ritonavir was measured in 117 breastfed (90% exclusive) infants whose mothers were taking lopinavir plus ritonavir for HIV infection during pregnancy and postpartum. At 8 and 12 weeks postpartum, none of the infants had detectable ritonavir in their plasma; 91% of infants had detectable ritonavir in their hair samples at 12 weeks postpartum at a mean concentration of 0.15 ng/mg of hair (range 0.03 to 0.42 ng/mg). The authors interpreted the results to mean that infants receive negligible exposure to ritonavir during breastfeeding.[6] Thirty nursing mothers were studied at 6, 12 or 24 weeks postpartum (10 at each time). Each mother was taking ritonavir 100 mg twice daily by mouth starting at delivery. Infant plasma samples were obtained before their mother's first dose and at 2, 4 and 6 hours after the mother's dose. Infants were allowed to breastfeed ad libitum during the study period.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: A nursing mother was given 1 dose of sodium stibogluconate 1 gram intravenously, followed by intravenous doses of 1.4 grams (about 20 mg/kg of antimony) daily for 14 days. Numerous milk samples were obtained before and for 25 hours after the fifth and fourteenth doses of the drug. The average of the 2 trough values of antimony in  milk was 0.7 mg/L; the average of the 2 peak concentrations was 3.5 mg/L at 4 hours after the dose.[1] (For comparison, average background antimony breastmilk concentrations range from 0.14 to 0.4 mcg/L[2][3]). After the sodium stibogluconate doses, milk antimony levels declined with a half-life of about 6 hours to a value of 0.7 mg/L at 23 hours after the dose.[1] Using the average of the peak and trough values, a fully breastfed infant would receive about 0.3 mg/kg daily of antimony or about 1.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.

A total of 16 concurrent maternal blood and milk samples were collected on days 1, 2, 3, and 7 postpartum between 10 minutes and 21 hours after the mothers' doses. Median peak and trough tenofovir concentrations in breastmilk were 14.1 mcg/L and 6.8 mcg/L, respectively. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 0.03% of the proposed infant dose for tenofovir and achieve trivial infant serum concentrations that would likely have no adverse consequences.[4] In a multicenter study in Malawi and Brazil, mothers were given a single dose of either 600 mg or 900 mg of tenofovir during labor.

The average peak milk concentration was 857 mcg/L (range 472 to 1043 mcg/L).[3] Eighteen women who were receiving oral zidovudine 300 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen had their milk analyzed at either 2 or 5 months postpartum. Milk samples were provided at a median of 4 hours (range 1 to 8.5 hours) after the last dose. The median zidovudine concentration in breastmilk was 207 mcg/L.[4] Forty women were given postpartum prophylaxis with unstated dosages of lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine (or stavudine if the hemoglobin   < 8 g/dL). Blood and milk samples were collected once during the first 3 days postpartum and once at 7 days postpartum. The median times after a dose that samples were collected were 5.3 hours (range 0 to 99 hours) for the first sample and 6 hours (range 4.3 to 20 hours) for the 7-day sample. Average breastmilk zidovudine concentrations were calculated only for samples that had detectable (  > 20 mcg/L) concentrations of zidovudine. The mean breastmilk concentrations were 130 (n = 11) and 150 mcg/L (n = 13), respectively, at the two sampling times, which was equal to the simultaneous maternal serum concentrations.[5] Fifty-eight mothers who were taking a combination regimen of lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine had their serum and breastmilk analyzed for the presence of these drugs. Mothers took zidovudine 200 mg twice daily starting at 34 to 36 weeks postpartum and continuing until 6 months postpartum. Breastmilk was collected within 24 hours after delivery and at 2, 6, 14 and 24 weeks postpartum at variable times after the previous dose. The median breastmilk zidovudine concentration in 35 selected samples across all visits was 9 mcg/L.[6] Thirty-eight mothers who were receiving zidovudine 300 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen provided a total of 114 milk samples at birth, 1 month, 3 months and/or 6 months postpartum.

Breastmilk samples were collected at just before a dose at a median of 1 month postpartum. Whole breastmilk levels contained a median of 7 mcg/L of zidovudine.[8] Thirty women were studied at 6, 12 or 24 weeks postpartum (10 at each time). Each mother was taking zidovudine 300 mg, lamivudine 150 mg, lopinavir 400 mg, and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily by mouth starting at delivery. On the study day, at a median of 14.9 hours after the previous evening's dose, maternal plasma and breastmilk samples were obtained prior to the morning dose and 2, 4 and 6 hours after the dose. Ninety-eight of the 121 breastmilk samples contained detectable quantities (10 mcg/L or greater) of zidovudine, with a median breastmilk concentration of 0.2 mg/L over the 6 hours.[9] Infant Levels: Eighteen nursing mothers were receiving oral zidovudine 300 mg twice daily as part of a combination antiretroviral regimen. Their infants had serum concentrations determined at either 2 or 5 months postpartum. Serum samples were provided at a median of 4 hours (range 1 to 8.5 hours) after the last dose. The infants were also receiving oral zidovudine 4 or 6 mg/kg 3 times daily, depending on their age. The median infant serum zidovudine concentration was 123 mcg/L (range 14 to 3302 mcg/L). The average value was 25 times the IC50 for HIV.[4] Fifty-eight infants whose mothers were taking a combination regimen of lamivudine, nevirapine and zidovudine had their serum analyzed for the presence of these drugs.

The infants' zidovudine plasma concentrations ranged from 0 to 2.5 mcg/L, which was a median of 2% (range 0 to 5%) of the maternal serum concentration.[7] Thirty-three infants were breastfed either partially or exclusively by their mothers who had been taking zidovudine 300 mg twice daily as part of a drug combination. Infant blood was collected at a median of 1 month postpartum for 24 infants and at 3 months postpartum for 9 infants at various times after the last dose and a median of 1 hour (range 6 minutes to 35 hours) after the last breastfeeding. None of the infants had detectable zidovudine levels in their serum (  < 45 mcg/L).[8] Thirty nursing mothers were studied at 6, 12 or 24 weeks postpartum (10 at each time). Each mother was taking zidovudine 300 mg twice daily by mouth starting at delivery. Infant plasma samples were obtained before their mother's first dose and at 2, 4 and 6 hours after the mother's dose. Infants were allowed to breastfeed ad libitum during the study period.

A higher percentage of infants in the HAART-exposed group had neutropenia than those in the unexposed group at 1 month of age (15.9 and 3.7%, respectively). Hematologic toxicity was transient and asymptomatic. From 2 to 6 months postpartum, no differences in hematologic toxicity were seen between breastfed and formula-fed infants. No statistical difference in hepatic toxicity was seen between the breastfed and formula-fed infants.[10] A study compared the rates of severe anemia in 3 groups of infants who received postpartum prophylaxis with zidovudine for prevention of maternal-to-child transmission of HIV infection. Through 6 months of age, breastfed infants whose mothers received HAART had a higher rate of severe anemia (7.4%) than breastfed infants whose mothers received only zidovudine (5.3%). Formula-fed infants had the lowest rate of severe anemia (2.5%). The anemia generally responded well to iron and multivitamin supplementation, and discontinuation of zidovudine.[11]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Although published data are limited, it appears that active components of marijuana are excreted into breastmilk in small quantities. Data are from random breastmilk screening rather than controlled studies because of ethical considerations in administering marijuana to nursing mothers. Concern has been expressed regarding marijuana's possible effects on neurotransmitters, nervous system development and endocannabinoid-related functions.[1][2] One long-term study found that daily or near daily use might retard the breastfed infant's motor development, but not growth or intellectual development.[3] This and another study[4] found that occasional maternal marijuana use during breastfeeding did not have any discernable effects on breastfed infants, but the studies were inadequate to rule out all long-term harm. Although marijuana can affect serum prolactin variably, it appears not to adversely affect the duration of lactation. Other factors to consider are the possibility of positive urine tests in breastfed infants, which might have legal implications, and the possibility of other harmful contaminants in street drugs. Health professionals' opinions on the acceptability of breastfeeding by marijuana-using mothers varies considerably.[5][6][7]<br><br>  Marijuana use should be minimized or avoided by nursing mothers because it may impair their judgment and child care abilities. Some evidence indicates that paternal marijuana use increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome in breastfed infants. Marijuana should not be smoked by anyone in the vicinity of infants because the infants may be exposed by inhaling the smoke. Because breastfeeding can mitigate some of the effects of smoking and little evidence of serious infant harm has been seen, it appears preferable to encourage mothers who use marijuana to continue breastfeeding and reducing or abstaining from marijuana use while minimizing infant exposure to marijuana smoke.[8][9][10]"
    drug_levels: "The main active component of marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), although it also contains other active compounds. THC is very fat soluble and persistent in the body fat of users and slowly released over days to weeks, depending on the extent of use. Maternal Levels: Two women who smoked marijuana daily while nursing had their randomly collected milk analyzed. One mother who reported smoking marijuana once daily had a milk tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of 105 mcg/L; other metabolites were absent. The second mother who reported smoking marijuana 7 to 8 times daily had a milk concentration of 340 mcg/L; the metabolite 11-hydroxy-THC was found in a concentration of 4 mcg/L and 9-carboxy-THC was absent. A milk sample that was collected 1 hour after smoking marijuana contained 60.3 mcg/L of THC, 1.1 mcg/L of 11-hydroxy-THC and 1.6 mcg/L of 9-carboxy-THC.[11] One source used data in this study to estimate that the infant receives about 0.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[12]A woman who admitted to smoking cannabis (amount not stated) donated milk for analysis. THC was present in a concentration of 86 mcg/L and 11-hydroxy-THC was present in a concentration of 5 mcg/L; 11-nor-carboxy-9-tetrahydrocannabinol was not detected.[13] Breastmilk from a mother who admitted to cannabis use contained THC in a concentration of 86 mcg/L and 11-hydroxy-THC in a concentration of 5 mcg/L. The time of collection and amount of drug use was not stated.[13] Infant Levels: The urine of 2 breastfed infants whose mothers smoked marijuana found none of the 9-carboxy-THC metabolite. One mother reported smoking marijuana once daily and the other reported smoking marijuana 7 to 8 times daily. Analysis of the feces of the latter mother's infant revealed a higher proportion of metabolites than THC, indicating that THC was probably absorbed from the milk, metabolized by the infant, and excreted in feces.[11]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Sixty-two infants whose mothers reported smoking marijuana during breastfeeding were compared at 1 year of age to the infants of mothers who smoked marijuana during pregnancy but not during breastfeeding. No differences were found in growth, or on mental and motor development.[4] Sixty-eight infants whose mothers reported smoking marijuana during breastfeeding were compared to 68 matched control infants whose mothers did not smoke marijuana. The duration of breastfeeding varied, but the majority of infants were breastfeed for 3 months and received less than 16 fluid ounces of formula daily. Motor development of the marijuana-exposed infants was slightly reduced in a dose-dependent (i.e., number of reported joints per week) manner at 1 year of age, especially among those who reported smoking marijuana on more than 15 days/month during the first month of lactation. No effect was found on mental development.[3] A small, case-control study found that paternal marijuana smoking postpartum increased the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. In this study, too few nursing mothers smoked marijuana to form any conclusion.[14] A study of women taking buprenorphine for opiate substitution during pregnancy and lactation found that 4 of the women were also using cannabis as evidenced by positive urine screens for THC between 29 and 56 days postpartum. One was also taking unprescribed benzodiazepines. One infant was exclusively breastfed and the other 3 were mostly breastfeeding with partial supplementation. Infants had no apparent drug-related adverse effects and showed satisfactory developmental progress.[15]"

Of 258 mothers who reported smoking marijuana during pregnancy, 62 who had smoked marijuana during breastfeeding were followed-up at 1 year. No difference was found in the age of weaning between these mothers and those who reported not smoking marijuana during breastfeeding.[4] A prospective study in a Canadian, middle-class population found no effect of maternal marijuana use during lactation and the duration of breastfeeding.[25]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "No data are available on the medical use of cocaine in nursing mothers. However, because of its chemical nature, high concentrations of cocaine are expected in milk.[1][2] Cocaine and its metabolites are detectable in breastmilk, although data are from random breastmilk screening of mothers who used cocaine recreationally rather than controlled studies. Cocaine breastmilk concentrations have varied over 100-fold in these reports. Newborn infants are extremely sensitive to cocaine because they have not yet developed the enzyme that inactivates it and serious adverse reactions have been reported in a newborn infant exposed to cocaine via breastmilk.<br><br>  Cocaine should not be used by nursing mothers or smoked (such as with \"crack\") by anyone in the vicinity of infants because the infants can be exposed by inhaling the smoke.[3][4] Other factors to consider are the possibility of positive urine tests in breastfed infants which might have legal implications, and the possibility of other harmful contaminants in street drugs. A breastfeeding abstinence period of 24 hours has been suggested for women who occasionally use cocaine while breastfeeding, based on the rapid elimination of cocaine by the mother.[5] Some authors have proposed that breastfeeding be discontinued only for those infants who test positive for cocaine exposure.[6] However, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine suggests that women who have abused cocaine generally should not breastfeed unless they have a negative maternal urine toxicology at delivery, have been abstinent for at least 90 days, are in a substance abuse treatment program and plan to continue it in the postpartum period, have the approval of their substance abuse counselor, have been engaged and compliant in their prenatal care, and have no other contraindications to breastfeeding.[7]"
    drug_levels: "Cocaine is metabolized to benzoylecgonine which serves as a marker for cocaine ingestion. Other cocaine metabolites include ecgonine methyl ester and norcocaine. When cocaine and alcohol are taken together, cocaethylene is produced; its metabolite is ethylbenzoylecgonine. Both of these compounds are markers for concurrent use of cocaine and alcohol. Maternal Levels. A woman reported using 500 mg of cocaine intranasally over a 4-hour period. Her milk contained about 10 to 15 mcg/L of cocaine 12 hours after ingestion that slowly decreased until 36 hours after the last use when it was unmeasurable. The benzoylecgonine concentration in her breastmilk was about 400 mcg/L at 12 hours after ingestion and dropped to undetectable levels by 36 hours post-ingestion.[8] Screening of breastmilk samples of postpartum women who admitted to having used cocaine prepartum found primarily cocaine and benzoylecgonine in breastmilk. Ecgonine methyl ester was usually not detected and only traces of norcocaine were detected, unless cocaine concentrations were very high. One such subject had a concentration of 12.1 mcg/L of cocaine, 4.1 mcg/L of benzoylecgonine and 119 mcg/L of norcocaine in her breastmilk.[9] Ethylbenzoylecgonine has been found in the breastmilk of mothers who ingested cocaine and alcohol.[1]Breastmilk from a mother who admitted to cocaine use contained cocaine in a concentration of 5 mcg/L. The time of collection and amount of drug use was not stated.[10] Two women suspected of cocaine use prior to delivery had cocaine levels of 8 and 10.3 mcg/L in their colostrum. Benzoylecgonine (7.8 mcg/L) and the pyrolytic products anhydroecgonine methyl ester (9.5 mcg/L) and anhydroecgonine (9.8 mcg/L) were also detected in the mother with the higher cocaine level in colostrum. The pyrolytic products resulted from smoking crack cocaine.[11] Infant Levels: A woman who was breastfeeding her 2-week-old daughter reported using about 500 mg of cocaine intranasally over a 4-hour period and breastfeeding 5 times during this period. The infant's urine contained cocaine in a concentration of about 100 mcg/L at 4 and 12 hours after the mother's last cocaine use; the concentration dropped to low levels by 24 hours, but was detectable up to 60 hours after the mother's last dose. The urine benzolyecgonine concentration was over 200 mcg/L at 4 hours post-ingestion and nearly 900 mcg/L at 12 hours post-ingestion. The benzolyecgonine concentration remained near 200 mcg/L until 60 hours post-ingestion when it was undetectable.[8] A 6-week-old, fullterm, breastfed infant was found to have benzoylecgonine in his urine. The infant appeared to be normal but was small for his age. The infant's mother reported using cocaine throughout pregnancy and postpartum.[12]"

Three hours after first ingesting the cocaine, the mother noted that her infant became markedly irritable, had dilated pupils, and began having vomiting and diarrhea. The infant became increasingly irritable and was taken to the emergency room 4 hours later. On examination, the infant was found to be tremulous and irritable with frequent startling after minimal stimulation, and to have high-pitched crying, hyperactive reflexes, mood lability, and hypertension. The infant also had some signs of fetal alcohol syndrome. The infant remained irritable 12 hours after the last cocaine exposure and remained tremulous and easily startled 24 hours after the last exposure. Irritability and tremulousness slowly abated over the subsequent 24 hours. Mild hypertension persisted up to 72 hours after the last cocaine exposure via breastmilk.[8] The mother of an 11-day-old infant applied cocaine powder to her nipples for pain relief. She then breastfed her infant using a breast shield that allowed protrusion of her nipples. Three hours later, she found the infant gasping, choking and blue. On arrival at the emergency room, the infant was ashen and cyanotic. He had hypertension, tachycardia, shallow breathing, hypothermia and was in status epilepticus. Seizures resolved in a few hours after treatment and the infant was discharged at 16 days of age with no apparent sequelae.[13] Although the infant's cocaine exposure was not via the drug in breastmilk, it illustrates the extreme risk of exposure of young infants to cocaine."
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Long-term cocaine use can result in chronic, low-level hyperprolactinemia.[14][15][16] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Information in this record refers only to the use of nicotine as a replacement product for smoking cessation. With a 21 mg transdermal patch, nicotine passes into breastmilk in amounts equivalent to smoking 17 cigarettes daily. Lower patch strengths of 7 and 14 mg provide proportionately lower amounts of nicotine to the breastfed infant. No studies on nicotine spray or nicotine gum use in nursing mothers have been reported. Maternal plasma nicotine concentrations after using the nicotine spray are about one-third those of smokers, so milk concentrations are probably proportionately less. Maternal nicotine plasma concentrations after using nicotine gum are variable depending on the vigor of chewing and number of pieces chewed daily, but can be similar to those attained after smoking cigarettes. One source recommends the shorter acting agents over the patches.[1]<br><br>  Some have advocated use of nicotine replacement products in smoking mothers to reduce the risk to breastfed infants of inhaled smoke and toxins in maternal cigarette smoke.[2][3] However, others point out that based on animal data, nicotine may increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome and might interfere with normal infant lung development. These authors recommend against using any form of nicotine in nursing mothers.[4][5] No studies have been performed to resolve these issues. An alternate smoking cessation product may be preferred during nursing."
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Fifteen lactating women who smoked an average of 17 (range 14 to 20) cigarettes daily were studied during smoking and after smoking cessation while using nicotine transdermal patches in decreasing doses of 21, 14 and 7 mg daily. One woman who smoked 6 cigarettes daily was started on the 14 mg daily patch. The women supplied milk samples from before and after each nursing on the day before attending their clinic appointments which were 2 to 3 weeks apart. Milk was analyzed for nicotine and its metabolite cotinine. During smoking, the milk nicotine concentration was about 200 mcg/L. Steady-state milk nicotine concentrations during the 21 mg patch was about 175 mcg/L which was not statistically different from smoking levels. Likewise, milk cotinine levels were not different between smoking and the 21 mg patch. Milk nicotine concentrations were lower than smoking levels with the 14 and 7 mg patches at about 140 and 70 mcg/L, respectively. Cotinine milk levels were also lower with these doses than with smoking. Calculated infant nicotine equivalent dosages (nicotine plus cotinine) were as follows: 25.2 mcg/kg/day with smoking, 23 mcg/kg/day with the 21 mg patch, 15.8 mcg/kg/day with the 14 mg patch, and 7.5 mcg/kg/day with the 7 mg patch. On average, infants ingest 1.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of nicotine and about 7.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage when cotinine was also considered.[2] Infant Levels: Nine breastfed infants with an average age of 4.8 months (range 2.5 to 21 months) whose mothers were using nicotine patches for smoking cessation had plasma concentrations of cotinine measured during maternal use of a 21 mg nicotine patch. Infant plasma cotinine averaged 22 mcg/L (range 19 to 25 mcg/L), which averaged 13.4% of the simultaneous maternal cotinine plasma concentrations.[2]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Maternal smoking is a major risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Nicotine is thought to be the causative factor by reducing the dopamine content of the carotid bodies and reducing the infant's ability to autoresuscitate during hypoxic episodes.[4] Nicotine in the breastmilk of smokers also appears to reduce the heart rate variability in male breastfed infants.[6] In a study of the infants of 5 mothers who were using 21 mg nicotine patches for smoking cessation, the infants' average Denver Developmental age was equivalent to their chronological age.[2]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Cigarette smoking reduces milk yield.[7][8] This effect may be caused by nicotine which lowers serum prolactin,[9] although other factors associated with smoking may also play a role.[10] In a study of 15 nursing mothers who were using nicotine patches in decreasing doses from 21 mg to 14 mg to 7 mg over several weeks, their average milk production was 17% lower than average literature values as judged by infant milk intake. The study did not directly compare the milk production of smokers to nonsmokers, however. In this study, infant milk intake during maternal use of the nicotine patch was similar to that during smoking.[2]"

Methamphetamine and its metabolite, amphetamine, are detectable in breastmilk and infant's serum after abuse of methamphetamine by nursing mothers. However, these data are from random collections rather than controlled studies because of ethical considerations in administering recreational methamphetamine to nursing mothers. Other factors to consider are the possibility of positive urine tests in breastfed infants which might have legal implications, and the possibility of other harmful contaminants in street drugs. In mothers who abuse methamphetamine while nursing, withholding breastfeeding for 24 to 48 hours after the maternal dose has been recommended.[1][2] However, breastfeeding is generally discouraged in mothers who are actively abusing amphetamines.[3][4][5][6]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Two nursing mothers who were intravenous methamphetamine abusers collected milk samples just before methamphetamine injection and every 2 to 6 hours after injection for 24 hours. Because the drugs were illicit street drugs, the doses of methamphetamine were not known. Peak and average milk methamphetamine concentrations were about 160 mcg/L and 111 mcg/L in one woman and 610 mcg/L and 281 mcg/L in the other, respectively. Milk methamphetamine concentrations fell with half-lives of 13.6 and 7.4 hours, respectively. Amphetamine, thought to be derived from metabolism of methamphetamine, was present in relatively constant concentrations in the milk of both mothers, averaging 4 and 15 mcg/L, respectively. The authors estimated that the infants would have received 16.7 and 42.2 mcg/kg per day of methamphetamine and 0.8 and 2.5 mcg/kg per day of amphetamine, respectively.[1] These estimated mg/kg infant doses of methamphetamine are lower than therapeutic doses of the equipotent dextroamphetamine for older children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, this is not evidence of safety for breastfed infants because the data on these two women can not be extrapolated to other methamphetamine abusers.Thirty-three mothers in Thailand were identified who had predelivery urine drug screens  positive for methamphetamine. On average they used methamphetamine 2.4 times per week, primarily by smoking crushed tablets. Of these, 22 had undetectable postpartum methamphetamine milk levels. Of the 11 mothers with methamphetamine in breastmilk, only two mothers had 4 consecutive milk samples containing methamphetamine that were analyzed. The mothers had smoked methamphetamine (dosage uncertain) 53 and 68 hours prior to delivery, respectively. First milk samples contained 142 and 345 mcg/L of methamphetamine in the two mothers. The half-lives of methamphetamine in breastmilk were 11.3 and 30.3 hours, respectively. The authors estimated that in the first 24 hours after birth their exclusively breastfed infant would have received 59.3 mcg or 21.3 mcg/kg/day in the first case and 93.0 mcg or 51.7 mcg/kg/day in the second case. Methamphetamine became undetectable in breastmilk about 100 hours after the last drug use in both mothers, which was about one day prior to the mothers' urine becoming negative for methamphetamine.[2] Infant Levels. Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A 2-month-old infant whose mother used illicit street methamphetamine recreationally by nasal inhalation was found dead 8 hours after a small amount of breastfeeding and ingestion of 120 to 180 mL of formula. The infant's serum methamphetamine concentration on autopsy was 39 mcg/L. Although the infant's mother was convicted of child endangerment for the use of methamphetamine during breastfeeding, the role that methamphetamine played in the infant's death has been questioned because of the low infant serum methamphetamine concentration and the mother's alleged minimal breastfeeding.[7][8]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg to a maximum of 17.5 mg of d-methamphetamine was given to 6 subjects (4 male and 2 female). Serum prolactin concentrations were unchanged over a period of 300 minutes after the dose.[9] In 2 papers by the same authors, 20 women with normal physiologic hyperprolactinemia were studied on days 2 or 3 postpartum. Eight received dextroamphetamine 7.5 mg intravenously, 6 received 15 mg intravenously and 6 who served as controls received intravenous saline. The 7.5 mg dose reduced serum prolactin by 25 to 32% compared to control, but the difference was not statistically significant. The 15 mg dose significantly decreased serum prolactin by 30 to 37% at times after the infusion. No assessment of milk production was presented. The authors also quoted data from another study showing that a 20 mg oral dose of dextroamphetamine produced a sustained suppression of serum prolactin by 40% in postpartum women.[10][11] A study compared 31 methamphetamine-dependent subject to 23 non-dependent subjects. The serum prolactin concentrations in the methamphetamine-dependent subjects were elevated at days 2 and 30 of abstinence. The elevation was greater in women than in men.[12] The maternal prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed. In a retrospective Australian study, mothers who used intravenous amphetamines during pregnancy were less likely to be breastfeeding their newborn infants at discharge than mothers who abused other drugs (27% vs 42%). The cause of this difference was not determined.[13] A prospective, multicenter study followed mothers who used methamphetamine prenatally (n = 204) to those who did not (n = 208). Mothers who used methamphetamine were less likely to breastfeed their infants (38%) at hospital discharge than those who did not use methamphetamine (76%).[14]"

The mother breastfed her infant (extent not stated) and the infant's urine was collected before the start of treatment and 4 times during maternal therapy with coal tar. The pyrene metabolite, 1-hydroxypyrene, was detected in all of the infant's urine samples. The baseline (pretreatment) concentration was 1.63 micromol/mol of creatinine. Subsequent (during maternal treatment) urine concentrations were 9.96, 97.1, 8.67 and 11.3 micromol/mol of creatinine. Since the mother's breastmilk contained no detectable pyrene or benzo[a]pyrene and only low levels of 1-hydroxypyrene, the authors postulated that the infant obtained the pyrene via skin-to-skin or skin-to-mouth contact with the mother and metabolized it to 1-hydroxypyrene.[2]"

Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date. Two postpartum women immunized with varicella vaccine provided preimmunization and serial postimmunization breastmilk samples (number not specified).

The infant did not demonstrate seroconversion or adverse reactions.[6] Some breastfed infants acquire passive immunity to rubella after maternal vaccination as do infants of mothers with natural rubella immunity. However, neither group of infants had a decreased response to rubella vaccine administered to the infant at 15 to 18 months of age.[7] After immunization of their mothers with rubella vaccine, 25% of breastfed infants in one study showed transient seroconversion to rubella virus but without any clinical disease.[8]"

No adverse reactions were noted in the infant.[1] A mother who was taking pilocarpine eye drops (concentration not stated) twice daily as well as 2 drops of timolol 0.5% eye drops daily and acetazolamide 250 mg orally twice daily and delivered a preterm infant at 36 weeks of gestation. The infant began 5 months of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 hours after birth. On day 2, the infant developed electrolyte abnormalities consisting of hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic acidosis. The infant was treated with oral calcium gluconate and a single dose of intramuscular magnesium sulfate. Despite continued breastfeeding and maternal drug therapy, the infant's mild metabolic acidosis disappeared on day 4 of life and the infant was gaining weight normally at 1, 3 and 8 months, but had mild hypotonicity. The authors considered the metabolic effects to be caused by transplacental passage of acetazolamide that resolved despite the infant being breastfed. The infant gained weight adequately during breastfeeding, but had some mild, residual hypertonicity of the lower limbs requiring physical therapy.[2]"

Breastfeeding protects infants against acute gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus.[1] However, breastfeeding can reduce the immune response of an infant to rotavirus vaccines.[2][3][4][5][6] The extent of the effect depends on the maternal anti-rotavirus antibody titer in breastmilk with higher titers found in less developed areas[7][8][9] Withholding breastfeeding for up to 2 hours before and after vaccine administration has been recommended to minimize the interference.[7][10] However, some studies have found that withholding breastfeeding for either one hour before and after immunization,[11][12] or for 30 minutes before vaccination had no effect on seroconversion.[13]<br><br>  A study in Indonesia found that rotavirus vaccine was cost-effective for the health system, even with improved breastfeeding rates.[14] A European study found no difference in rotavirus infection rates during the first season between infants who were breastfed and formula-fed when they received rotavirus vaccination. In the second season, protection against infection was slightly less in breastfed infants.[5] A German study found that exclusive or partial breastfeeding increased the risk of breakthrough infection fourfold.[6]"

The serum antirotavirus IgA concentrations were 185.8 units/mL and 231.5 units/mL in the breastfed and exclusively formula-fed infants, respectively.[5] Two hundred fifty breastfed infants were randomized to receive their routine rotavirus vaccination (Rotarix) with either unrestricted breastfeeding or withholding breastfeeding from 1 hour before to 1 hour after the vaccination. No difference were found in the rate of seroconversion between the two groups of infants.[11] Four hundred infants in India were randomized to either be breastfed before receiving rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) or to not be breastfed within 30 minutes of their vaccination. Vaccinations were given at 6 to 7 weeks and at 10 to 14 weeks of age. Of the 388 infants with evaluable information, no difference was found in the seroconversion rate between the two groups.[13]Among 45 breastfed (at least 4 times daily) Nicaraguan infants who were given a rotavirus vaccination (Rotateq-MSD), 31 infants seroconverted and 14 infants did not. The seroconversion failures were mostly in infants who had high preimmunization IgA levels and whose mothers had high serum IgG antibody levels against rotavirus. No correlation was found between breastmilk IgA or neutralizing antibodies and seroconversion, although the sample size was small.[15]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "High-dose breast radiation for the therapy of breast cancer can decrease or eliminate subsequent milk production in the treated breast, but not the untreated breast. Medical professionals sometimes advise mothers who have received breast cancer surgery and radiation not to breastfeed; however, it appears that these concerns are unfounded. Lower radiation doses to the breast in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma appear to have only a minor effect on subsequent lactation success, but cranial irradiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma can reduce subsequent breastmilk production. Women who were treated as children for leukemia with cranial radiation often have difficulty in nursing their infants. For information on diagnostic X-rays, see the LactMed entry for X-rays."

    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A systematic review compiled data from 102 patients treated with breast irradiation and their subsequent lactation experience. The authors found a large variation in milk output of the irradiated breast, which may be due to the type and intensity of the radiation, or concomitant surgery. Two studies found changes in breastmilk in the irradiated breast compared to the untreated breast, including  elevated sodium, and reduced potassium, phosphate and triglycerides. Most patients could breastfeed successfully using the untreated breast. Cranial irradiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma or during childhood for leukemia can also reduce subsequent breastmilk production.[1] Twenty women were identified from the European Institute of Oncology database who had breast cancer from 1988 to 2006 who agreed to take a survey of breastfeeding behavior. Fourteen of 15 women who underwent breast conserving surgery followed by irradiation reported hypoplasia of the irradiated breast during pregnancy. Of the 15 women, eight did not attempt to breastfeed. Of the 7 who attempted breastfeeding, one woman successfully breastfed 2 infants (2 pregnancies) for more than 6 months, one other successfully breastfed for 11 months. The duration of nursing in the other 5 women is unclear in the paper. Only two women attempted to breastfeed from both breasts, and both could breastfeed from both breasts for only 2 weeks because of reduced milk production. Of the women who did not attempt breastfeeding, medical counseling against breastfeeding was a major reason because of \"uncertainty regarding maternal safety\", and \"a priori unfeasibility\" expressed either by the obstetrician or the oncologist.[2]Of 12 women who had been treated for childhood leukemia with 24 to 25 Gy of prophylactic cranial irradiation, 10 reported an inability to breastfeed postpartum. Nine of the 12 women had an adult height more than 1 SD below their heights at diagnosis, 4 of whom were more than 2 SD below height at diagnosis; one women had a low serum growth hormone level, all suggesting growth hormone deficiency as a possible cause of lactation failure. The 10 women who failed to lactate had minimal or no breast changes during pregnancy and did not produce any breastmilk, including 2 who used metocopramide as a galactagogue. Two of the 10 women produced some colostrum and one produced a small amount of colostrum with only her second pregnancy Among the other women with multiple pregnancies, each attempt at lactation was similar. The two women who were able to breastfeed had no distinguishable differences from the others.[3] A study of 44 women who were treated with cranial radiotherapy of 18 to 30 Gy as children for leukemia was conducted 8 to 20 years following radiotherapy. Forty were growth hormone deficient and 4 were growth hormone insufficient. Seven of the women became pregnant at 18 to 22 years after therapy while taking growth hormone replacement therapy. Growth hormone therapy was discontinued in the second trimester and restarted 6 months postpartum. Six of the 7 women were unable to lactate. Stimulation with thyrotropin-releasing hormone showed a lower prolactin response among women who had undergone radiotherapy than in matched controls.[4]"

Seven milk samples in total were obtained on days 2, 3, 6, and 8 of therapy. The average of the milk level with the 24 mg daily dosage was 20 mcg/L and with the 14 mg daily dosage it was 5 mcg/L. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.8 to 3 mcg/kg daily with the maternal doses given or 0.3 to 0.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[2] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

She took a daily oral dose of 1 mg of flupenthixol during pregnancy and 4 mg daily starting on the first day postpartum. Milk samples were taken 7 times over 36 hours on days 6 and 7 postpartum. The highest milk flupenthixol level of 6.8 mcg/L occurred 4.5 hours after the dose, and the average of the milk levels was 2.8 mcg/L. Milk flupenthixol levels measured on day 20 postpartum at 2 hours after the dose averaged 2.2 mcg/L with a maternal dose of 3 mg daily. On day 48 postpartum, flupenthixol was undetectable (  < 2 mcg/L) in milk 3.5 hours after a maternal dosage of 2 mg daily. Milk levels taken after feeding were much higher than those taken before feeding, probably because of higher concentrations in the more fat-rich hindmilk. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive 0.4 mcg/kg daily or 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[2] Infant Levels:  A woman took flupenthixol 1 mg and nortriptyline 100 mg daily during pregnancy and flupenthixol 4 mg and nortriptyline 125 mg daily immediately postpartum.

Milk samples were taken before the dose and 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 hours after the dose. Peak milk levels of moclobemide and its major inactive metabolite, Ro 12-8095, occurred 3 hours after the dose. The average 24-hour excretion of moclobemide in milk was 0.17 mg (range 0.11 to 0.28 mg) and of Ro 12-8095 was 0.1 mg  (range 0.05 to 0.14 mg). The active metabolite, Ro 12-5637, was not detectable (assay limit not stated) in breastmilk. The authors estimated that this amount would be equal to approximately 1% of the weight-adjusted maternal dosage.[1] Eight women were being treated for postpartum depression with moclobemide in daily dosages ranging from 300 mg to 900 mg. After at least 2 weeks of therapy, single blood and milk samples were collected from each patient within 4 hours after the dose. Average breastmilk levels were as follows: 300 mg daily (n = 2), 1.6 mg/L; 450 mg daily (n = 3), 1.24 mg/L; 600 mg daily (n = 2), 2 mg/L and 900 mg (n = 1) 5.3 mg/L. The Ro12-5637 metabolite was not detected and the Ro12-8095, was not quantified.[2] Using data in presented in the paper, the maximum amount of moclobemide that an infant would receive is estimated to be about 4% (range 2% to 6%) of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Eighteen lactating women were given 100 mg of trans-anethol in a capsule on 3 test days. Milk samples were collected every 2 hours for 8 hours starting at the time of ingestion. Trans-anethol was detected in milk at all collection times, with the average concentrations of 2 mcg/L at 0 hours, 9.9 mcg/L at 2 hours, 9.2 mcg/L at 4 hours, 7.3 mcg/L at 6 hours and 4.3 mcg/L at 8 hours after the dose. The average peak anenthol concentration in milk was 23.2 mcg/L. Only small amounts of anenthol glucuronide metabolites were present in the milk samples.[9] Five women who were nursing infants between 6 and 55 weeks of age drank 950 mL of fennel-anise-caraway tea (Messmer Ostfriesische Tee Gesellschaft Laurens Spethmann GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Seevetal, Germany). The main odorant components of the tea are the following terpenes: limonene, 1,8-cineole, fenchone, estragole, carvone, trans-anethole, p-anisaldehyde and anisketone. Mothers collected milk samples at 30 minutes, 1 and 2 hours after ingesting the tea. Ingestion of the tea did not increase the overall terpene content of the milk, but there was wide variation from mother to mother. Some mothers had high background levels of some terpenes, probably from other foods or person care products. In addition, a sensory panel found no significant change in the odor profile of the breastmilk samples compared to blank samples.[10] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Two breastfed infants, aged 15 and 20 days, were admitted to the hospital for a reported lack of weight gain in the previous 7 to 10 days, caused by \"difficult feeding\". The parents reported restlessness and vomiting during the past day. One of the mothers also reported feeling drowsy and weak. On examination, the infants were afebrile but had hypotonia, lethargy, emesis, weak cry, poor sucking and weak responses to painful stimuli. Infant laboratory values, electrocardiograms and blood pressures were normal, and septic work-ups were negative. Both mothers had both been drinking more than 2 liters daily of an herbal tea mixture reportedly containing licorice, fennel, anise, and goat's rue to stimulate lactation. After the mothers discontinued breastfeeding and the herbal tea, the infants improved within 24 to 36 hours. Symptoms of the affected mother also resolved rapidly after discontinuing the herbal tea. After 2 days, breastfeeding was reinstituted with no further symptoms in the infants. Both infants were doing well at 6 months of age. The authors attributed the maternal and infant symptoms to anethole, which is found in both anise and fennel; however, the anethole levels were not measured in breastmilk, nor were the teas tested for their content.[11]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A group of 5 nursing mothers were given no herb for 5 days, 15 mL of a 5% infusion of anise 3 times daily for 10 days, followed by another 5-day control period from days 15 to 20. Their diet and environment were kept constant during the study period. Milk volume was measured daily and milk fat percentage was measured on days 5, 10, 15 and 20. The increase in milk volume was variable, from substantial increases to no effect to decreases in volume at the end of the study period. No overall changes in milk fat were observed.[12] Because of the lack of randomization, blinding and controls, and small number of participants, no valid conclusion can be made from this study on the galactogogue effects of anise. In an uncontrolled, nonblinded study, 5 nursing mothers were given 4 cups of anise tea (preparation method not stated) daily to determine if milk production was improved. The measured endpoint was duration of lactation in the current pregnancy compared to the previous pregnancy based on maternal reporting. Treated women had trivial increases in duration of lactation from 10 days in the previous pregnancy to 15 days with use of the tea.[13] Because of the faulty study design and small number of participants, no valid conclusion can be made from this study on the galactogogue effects of anise."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) leaves have been applied topically to the breasts to treat breast engorgement.[1][2][3][4] Some investigators cut out a hole in the leaves to keep the nipples dry. Leaves have been applied frozen, refrigerated or at room temperature. Various studies found cabbage leaves beneficial for reducing breast engorgement and pain regardless of temperature. However, a meta-analysis concluded that there is no good evidence that topical cabbage leaves were better than no treatment, because engorgement tends to improve over time regardless of treatment. The authors felt that the intervention was cheap, unlikely to cause harm and might be soothing for the mother.[5] Unrestricted nursing of the infant may be an important factor in reducing engorgement.[1][4] Some low-quality evidence indicates that maternal cabbage ingestion might cause colic in their breastfed infants.[6]"

Maternal cabbage intake was studied as a possible cause of colic in breastfed infants. A questionnaire was sent to nursing mothers asking about food intake during the previous week and their infants' symptoms of colic during that time. Seventy-three mothers who reported colic in their infants during the prior week were 30% more likely to have eaten cabbage during this time than mothers of infants who did not have colic during the previous week. Additionally, many other mothers reported avoiding cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower) because of previous symptoms of colic in their breastfed infants that they attributed to these foods.[6]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "In a randomized, nonblinded study, postpartum hospitalized women with breast engorgement during breastfeeding either applied refrigerated cabbage leaves to their breasts (n = 59) or received routine hospital care (n = 56). The women who used the cabbage leaves breastfed exclusively for slightly longer than those who did not (36 vs 30 days). At 6 weeks postpartum, there was no statistical difference in the percentage of women breastfeeding between the two groups The authors felt that any difference was most likely caused by psychological mechanisms in the mothers than the cabbage leaves.[1] This study suffered from a 20% loss to follow-up. A study investigated cabbage leaves at different temperatures in the treatment of breast engorgement in hospitalized postpartum women (n = 28). Each mother received chilled leaves to one breast and room temperature leaves to the other in a randomized order. Both treatments reduced perceived breast pain, but no difference was found between the chilled and room temperature cabbage leaves in reducing the pain of engorgement.[2] A study compared chilled cabbage leaves to cold gelpacks in the treatment of breast engorgement in hospitalized postpartum women (n = 33). Both had cutout areas around the nipple. Affected women applied a cabbage leaf to one breast and the gelpack to the other as needed at 2- to 4-hour intervals. There was no difference in the breast pain reduction between the cabbage leaves and gelpacks.[3] A randomized, double-blind study compared a cream containing cabbage extract (n = 21) to a placebo cream (n = 18) for treating breast engorgement. The cream was specially made for the study using a 1% cabbage extract according to the methods of the British Pharmacopoeia and the same cream base as the placebo. Mothers rated their pain and breast firmness, and a device was used by researchers to measure breast firmness. Both treatments improved all measured parameters, with no difference between the two treatments. Nursing the infant had a greater effect on perceptions of discomfort and the hardness of the breast tissue than either of the creams.[4] A study compared the effectiveness of topical use of alternating cold and hot compresses (n = 30) to frozen cabbage leaves (n = 30) for the treatment of breast engorgement. The study was not randomized or blinded. Each treatment was applied for 30 minutes 3 times daily for 2 days. Outcomes were judged using breast engorgement and  pain scales, although it is unclear who did the rating. Both treatments were effective in reducing pain and engorgement. The authors concluded that hot and cold compresses were more effective than cabbage leaves,[7] but this conclusion is not justified by the study design. An uncontrolled pilot study in 30 women with breast engorgement compared pain scores before and after the mothers applied refrigerated cabbage leaves to their breasts twice daily for 3 days for 15 to 20 minutes. Engorgement scores were lower after 3 days than at the beginning of the study.[8]"

Maternal Levels: A study of human milk from mothers of preterm (n = 17) and fullterm (n = 16) infants found several lecithin components, such as choline, phosphocholine, and phosphatidylcholine. Choline levels in fullterm milk were higher (116 micromoles/L) than in preterm milk (98 micromoles/L). Choline ester concentrations were not different between the two types of milk. Phosphatidylcholine choline levels were sightly higher (90 micromoles/L) than in fullterm milk (82 micromoles/L), but the difference was not statistically significant.[5] Longitudinal analysis of human milk samples from 8 mothers found that choline levels increased from 110 micromoles/L during days 2 to 6 postpartum to 210 micromoles/L during days 7 to 22. Phosphatidylcholine increased from 70 micromoles/L to 100 micromoles/L over the same time periods.[6] A study of 103 pregnant women measured the choline content of their milk through 45 days postpartum. Participants were given a daily supplement of 5400 mg of phosphatidylcholine (PhosChol brand) equal to 750 mg of choline (n = 48) or a placebo (n = 48). The daily dosage was divided equally between morning and evening. At 45 days postpartum, breastmilk choline concentrations were statistically different at 83 micromoles/L in the placebo group and 106 micromoles/L in the supplemented group. Phosphatidylcholine concentrations were not statistically different at 107 micromoles/L in the placebo group and 113 micromoles/L in the supplemented group.[7] Lactating women were given either 480 or 930 mg of choline daily.

Neither hypericin (  < 0.2 mcg/L) nor hyperforin (  < 0.5 mcg/L) were detectable in the infant's plasma.[5] Two infants were exclusively breastfed by mothers who had been taking St. John's wort (Jarsin brand) 300 mg 3 times daily for at least 4 weeks. Infant blood samples were taken when the infants were 10 and 22 weeks old, respectively. Both of their plasma hyperforin concentrations were at the limit of detection of 0.1 mcg/L.[6]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A woman took St. John's wort 300 mg daily (product details not specified) during pregnancy, discontinued it at term and then reinstituted it at 20 days postpartum. Her breastfed (extent not stated) infant was found to have a normal behavioral assessment on days 4 and 33.[9] A postpartum woman with depression began taking St. John's wort (Jarsin brand) 300 mg 3 times daily starting at 5 months postpartum. At 7 months postpartum, no side effects were noted in her breastfed (extent not stated) infant and the infant's developmental score was normal.[5] A matched cohort study compared 33 women who reported that they had taken St. John's wort during breastfeeding to 2 control groups who were either disease matched (primarily depression), or age and parity matched. The duration of breastfeeding was similar across all groups and ranged from a mean of 10.8 to 12.1 months. Formula was introduced on average between 4.3 and 6.3 months, with no statistical differences between groups. The brands of St. John's wort used were not reported. The average daily dosage was 705 mg (range 225 to 2150 mg daily), and the average duration of therapy was 1.5 months, beginning at 4.2 months (range 0 to 11 months) postpartum. The average duration of St. John's wort exposure in the infants via breastmilk was 2.1 months. Mothers who were taking St. John's wort more frequently reported infant colic (n = 2), drowsiness (n = 2) and lethargy (n = 1) than mothers in the other groups in which only 1 case of colic was reported in each group. The difference was statistically significant between the treatment and disease-matched control groups. Between these 2 groups, there were no differences in the proportion of women taking conventional antidepressants overall or among mothers of affected infants, or in the dosages the mothers took. None of the affected infants required specific medical treatment and there was no difference in weight gain between subsets of the groups in whom weight could be obtained between 15 and 16 months of age.[10] Five women who were 10 to 22 weeks postpartum had been taking St. John's wort (Jarsin brand) 300 mg 3 times daily for at least 4 weeks and exclusively breastfeeding their infants. Mothers were asked if they had noticed any gastrointestinal symptoms, lethargy, rashes, photosensitivity, or changes in sleep pattern. None of the mothers observed any adverse effects or unusual behavior in their infants, and the infants grew normally during maternal therapy.[6]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "In a matched cohort study of 33 women who reported that they had taken St. John's wort during breastfeeding (described in more detail above in \"Reported Side Effects In Breastfed Infants\"), no evidence was found of lower milk production among mothers taking St. John's wort during breastfeeding.[10] Thirty-six women with mild premenstrual syndrome received St. John's wort 450 mg twice daily as coated tablets (Jarsin brand) or placebo for two menstrual cycles. Serum prolactin levels of the women randomized to active treatment (n = 19) were not statistically different from those of the women who received placebo (n = 17) in either the follicular or luteal phase of their menstrual cycles.[11]Studies in healthy volunteer males (n = 12) given single doses of 2700 mg of St. John's wort (Jarsin brand) had a drop in serum prolactin that was statistically significant between 150 and 210 minutes after administration.[12] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Garlic (Allium sativum) contains alliin, which is metabolized by the enzyme alliinase to allicin, thought to be responsible for most of garlic's medicinal properties and odor. Garlic has been used to lower cholesterol and blood pressure. It has no specific indications for use during lactation in western countries. Garlic has been used as a galactogogue in India,[1][2] although no scientific data could be located on its use alone as a galactogogue. Garlic's odor is transmitted to breastmilk, which may increase infant sucking time acutely and might enhance the breastfed infant's food choices in the long term. Garlic has a long history of use as a food and medicine and is \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) as a food flavoring by the US Food and Drug Administration, including during lactation.[3] Limited scientific data found that a few days of oral garlic supplementation caused no adverse effects in nursing mothers or infants. When used as a medicinal, garlic is generally well tolerated in adults, but gastrointestinal side effects and bad breath and body odor may occur. Garlic has anti-platelet effects and should be used cautiously by women at risk for bleeding. Garlic can cause allergies and should be avoided by persons allergic to garlic or other members of the lily family, such as hyacinth, tulip, onion, leek, and chives. Topical application of garlic can cause dermatitis and burns and should be used with caution, especially in infants. One nursing mother received severe burns to the breast from prolonged (2 days) application of a poultice of raw, crushed garlic to treat a self-diagnosed Candida infection.[4]<br><br>Dietary supplements do not require extensive pre-marketing approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Mothers given placebo or 1.5 g of garlic (General Nutrition Center, Pittsburgh, PA) in capsules once daily extracted about 20 mL of breastmilk every hour for 4 hours after garlic ingestion. A panel of 11 men and women who were blinded to maternal product ingestion rated the perceived odor of garlic in each sample. Garlic odor was most strongly perceived at 2 hours after maternal garlic ingestion. The odor remained equally perceptible at 3 hours after ingestion in some mothers' milk.[5] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Maternal garlic ingestion has a reputation for causing colic in breastfed infants. Two papers tend to refute this claim. In one, 153 mothers who answered a questionnaire were no more likely to report colic in their infants in the previous week if they had ingested garlic than if they had not.[6] In another, mothers who were given either 1.5 grams of garlic or placebo capsules once daily in a blinded fashion for 3 days were asked if their infants had exhibited any signs of colic after capsule ingestion (were fussier, cried more or had more gas). Four of 20 women who ingested garlic thought their infants had colic; however, 4 of 10 women who received placebo thought they had received garlic and reported colic in their infants.[7]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Forty women who complained of an insufficient milk supply at 5 days postpartum were given a combination herbal supplement as 2 capsules of Lactare (Pharma Private Ltd., Madras, India) 3 times daily. Each capsule contained wild asparagus 200 mg, ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) 100 mg, fenugreek 50 mg, licorice 50 mg, and garlic 20 mg. By day 4 of therapy, no infants required supplementary feeding. Infants were weighed before and after each feeding on the fifth day of maternal therapy to determine the amount of milk ingested. On the day of the test weighing, infants' milk intake averaged 388 mL, and the fluid and caloric intake was considered adequate.[8] This study cannot be considered as valid evidence of a galactogogue effect of these herbs because it lacks randomization, blinding, a placebo control, and maternal instruction in breastfeeding technique. Additionally, infants were breastfed only 6 to 8 times daily, which is insufficient to maximize milk supply. In two studies conducted by the same investigators, capsules containing 1.5 g of garlic extract (General Nutrition Center, Pittsburgh, PA) were given to nursing mothers. In the first experiment, 8 mothers receive a garlic capsule or placebo once daily in a crossover fashion. Garlic-naive infants whose mothers ingested garlic capsules spent more time (33 vs 27 minutes) attached to the nipple during the time period of 1.5 to 3 hours after garlic ingestion when garlic odor in milk was maximal than in those whose mothers received a placebo; however, total number of nursings or total amount of milk ingestion did not differ between groups.[5] A study randomized nursing mothers to receive garlic capsules or placebo for 3 days before testing with a single capsule as in the study above. Infants who received garlic in the milk for the first time spent 30% more time nursing than after placebo. Infants who had been previously exposed to garlic in milk, did not spend more time nursing after subsequent garlic exposure in milk.[7] The authors interpreted the results of these studies as having a positive effect on infants' later food choices (i.e., being less \"picky\" about foods).[9]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seeds contain mucilage, trigonelline, 4-hydroxyisoleucine, sotolon, diosgenin, phenolic acids, and protodioscin. Fenugreek has been used in a number of geographical regions worldwide as a galactogogue to increase milk supply,[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] and is included in numerous proprietary mixtures promoted to increase milk supply. Evidence for a galactogogue effect is mostly anecdotal. A limited number of published studies of low to moderate quality have found mixed results for a galactogogue effect for fenugreek.[11][12][13][14] The galactogogue effect of fenugreek may be primarily psychological,[15] Some of these studies used a multi-ingredient combination products in which fenugreek was only one component, so the results might be different from studies in which fenugreek was used alone. Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production.[16]<br><br>  Fenugreek is \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) as a flavoring by the US Food and Drug Administration. Limited scientific data exist on the safety of fenugreek in nursing mothers or infants, although it has a long history of use as a food and medicine in India and China. When used as a medicinal, it is generally well tolerated in adults, but gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea and flatulence may occur. Allergic reactions, exacerbation of asthma, and a 14% decrease in serum potassium have been reported. One nursing mother developed toxic epidermal necrolysis thought to be cause by her intake of fenugreek as a galactagogue. Cross-reactions with chickpeas, peanuts, and other legumes are possible. Dosages typically used to increase milk supply are 1 to 6 grams daily; in dosages of about 25 grams or more daily, fenugreek may cause lowering of cholesterol and blood sugar. It can also interact with warfarin to cause bleeding. Caution should be used in giving high dosages to women with diabetes mellitus or those taking warfarin. Perhaps its most unusual side effect is the imparting an odor of maple syrup to the urine, sweat, feces, and possibly breastmilk by the sotolon in fenugreek.[6][17][18][19]<br><br>  Dietary supplements do not require extensive pre-marketing approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.

Additionally, infants were breastfed only 6 to 8 times daily, which is insufficient to maximize milk supply. A study of healthy women who delivered a fullterm infant and desired to breastfeed for at least 4 months compared fenugreek, torbangun (Coleus amboinicus) and a product containing placental extract and vitamin B12 (Molocco+B12) for their effects on breastmilk volume. No mention was made of any breastfeeding support provided to the women. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the products for 30 days and followed for another 30 days. Capsules containing powdered fenugreek seeds 600 mg (Bullivants Natural Health, Auckland, New Zealand) were given 3 times daily. Infants were weighed before and after each nursing at 2-week intervals during the study to measure 24-hour milk volume. At no time point during the study was milk volume in the fenugreek group (n = 22) statistically different from the reference group (n = 22) who received Molocco+B12, although the torbangun group did have a statistically significant increase. The daily volume of milk actually decreased in the fenugreek group over time, although the change was not statistically significant.[22] The dosage of fenugreek used in this study was lower than that typically recommended by most sources.[4][23][24] A study was performed in 10 postpartum women who delivered preterm infants (24 to 38 weeks gestation) and had been pumping their milk for at least 14 days, but usually 3 to 4 weeks. The women recorded their baseline pumped milk volumes during one week and then took one 610 mg fenugreek capsule (Nature's Way) 3 times daily for a second week during which they recorded milk volumes. Average daily milk volumes increased from 207 mL in week 1 (range 57 to 1057 mL) to 464 mL (range 63 to 1140 mL) in week 2.[14] This study was neither randomized nor blinded and did not have a placebo control group, so the result is questionable. A study in 26 mothers of preterm infants less than 31 weeks gestation compared fenugreek (product and dosage not stated) 3 capsules 3 times daily for 21 days to placebo. Mothers began pumping within 12 hours of delivery and recorded pumping frequency and milk volume. Maternal serum prolactin was also measured weekly during the 21 days. No statistical differences were found in milk volumes or serum prolactin values between the two groups.[20] The study is thus far published only in abstract form, so many study details are missing. Sixty-six postpartum mothers (22 in each of 3 groups) with no concurrent illnesses were randomly assigned to receive an herbal tea, placebo, or nothing after delivering healthy, fullterm infants. Mothers in the herbal tea group received at least 3 cups daily of 200 mL of Still Tea (Humana-Istanbul, Turkey; containing hibiscus 2.6 grams, fennel extract 200 mg, fennel oil 20 mg, rooibos 200 mg, verbena [vervain] 200 mg, raspberry leaves 200 mg, fenugreek 100 mg, goat's rue  100 mg, and, vitamin C 500 mg per 100 grams, per manufacturer's web site November 2011). A similar-looking apple tea was used as the placebo. All women were followed by the same nurse and pediatrician who were blinded to what treatment the mothers received. Mothers who received the Still Tea produced more breastmilk with an electric breast pump on the third day postpartum than mothers in the other groups. The infants in the Still Tea group had a lower maximum weight loss, and they regained their birth weights sooner than those in the placebo or no treatment arms. No long-term outcome data were collected. Because many of the ingredients in Still Tea are purported galactogogues, no single ingredient can be considered solely responsible for the tea's effects, although the authors attributed the action to fenugreek.[25] An herbal tea containing fenugreek, hibiscus, fennel, rooibos, vervain, raspberry, goat's rue, and vitamin C (Humana Still-Tee, Humana GmbH, Herford, Germany) or water was randomly given to nursing mothers in a dosage of 3 cups daily beginning on the day of delivery. Several markers of antioxidant capacity were measured in breastmilk on day 1 and again after 7 to 10 days. No difference was found in the markers between mothers who received the tea and the water.[26] A nonblinded study randomized mother to receive 2 grams of fenugreek as a tea three times a day, 100 grams of palm date flesh three times a day, or nothing beginning on the first day postpartum. The duration of therapy was not stated. Their full-term, healthy infants were weighed on days 3, 7 and 14 of age, and mothers measured the morning (only) milk volume from both breasts on the third day postpartum. The infants of the fenugreek and date flesh groups lost less weight on days 3 and 7 than the control mothers, but there was no difference in weight among the groups on day 14. On day 3, morning milk volumes were greater in the two treated groups than in the untreated group.[27] The lack of blinding and incomplete milk collection call the results into question. A nonblinded study compared several infant growth parameters after their mothers were randomized to receive either black tea or black tea plus 7.5 grams of fenugreek three times daily. Infants were healthy girls and ranged from 0 to 4 months old (mean about 2 months). At baseline, control mothers were breastfeeding two times more per day than the fenugreek group (11.2 vs 9.2 times/day). At the end of the 4 week study, several parameters were greater in the fenugreek group than in the control group: frequency of feeding infant weight, head circumference, and daily numbers of wet diapers and defecation. No difference was seen in infant height.[28]"

    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A study in Japan compared the use of a mixture of 13 herbs, including ginger, to ergonovine for their effects on lactation and serum prolactin in postpartum women. The herbal mixture, called Xiong-gui-tiao-xue-yin, was given in a randomized fashion to 41 women in a dose of 2 grams of a dried aqueous extract 3 times daily. A comparable group of 41 women were randomized to receive methylergonovine 0.375 mg daily. Therapy was started on the day of delivery, but the duration of therapy was not specified. Plasma oxytocin and prolactin were measured on days 1 and 6; milk volumes were measured daily, although the method of measuring milk volume was not specified. Serum prolactin was higher on days 1 and 6 in the women who received the herbals; plasma oxytocin was lower on day 1 in the women who received the herbal, but not different on day 6. Milk volumes were greater on days 4, 5, and 6 in women who received the herbal mixture.[5] This study has serious flaws that make its interpretation impossible. First, milk volume measurement is subject to considerable variability depending on the measurement method used, but the method was not specified. Second, methylergonovine has caused decreases in serum prolactin and milk production in some studies.[6][7] Because of the lack of a placebo group, the differences found could be a negative effect of methylergonovine rather than a positive effect of the herbal preparation. Because this study used a multi-ingredient combination products in which ginger was only one component, the results might be different from studies in which ginger was used alone. Studies of Thai herbal compresses containing ginger, turmeric and camphor have evaluated the effect of application of the compresses to the breasts on lactation. The studies showed that the compresses shortened the time to lactation postpartum compared to routine clinical care for enhancing lactation.[2]"

Coenzyme Q10 is a normal component of human milk; however, values appear to vary depending on the country in which they are measured, possibly because of dietary, genetic or other population differences as well as assay differences.[1] Maternal Levels: A study in 15 Italian mothers found a mean milk coenzyme Q10 concentrations of 1.6 mg/L at 4 days postpartum, compared to a maternal plasma concentration of 1.29 mg/L at the time of delivery.[2] Coenzyme Q10 milk levels were measured in 23 German women who were between 24 to 48 hours postpartum, and again at 7 and 14 days postpartum. Milk levels were 1.1, 1.0 and 0.9 mg/L, respectively, at those times. The study found no correlation between maternal plasma levels and milk coenzyme Q10 levels in mature milk.[3] Coenzyme Q10 milk levels were measured in 30 Spanish women on days 3, 8 and 30 postpartum. Half had delivered preterm infants and the other half had delivered fullterm infants. The estimated intake of coenzyme Q10 from food diaries were 3.2 mg daily in the preterm group and 2.7 mg daily in the fullterm group. In the preterm group, milk levels were 0.43, 0.39 and 0.36 mg/L, respectively, at those times. In the fullterm group, milk levels were 0.69, 0.65 and 0.47 mg/L, respectively, at those times.[4] Forty-three breastmilk samples were obtained from 32 Japanese women during the first 8 days postpartum. The mean coenzyme Q10 concentration was 0.35 mcg/L.[5]Thirty-nine lactating women in the United States donated 194 samples of breastmilk for analysis. The average milk concentration of coenzyme Q10 was 0.27 mcg/L.[1] Infant Levels: Plasma concentrations of coenzyme Q10 have not been measured in the plasma of breastfed infants after maternal supplementation. However, a study in 15 Italian mothers and their breastfed infants found infant coenzyme Q10 plasma concentrations of 49 mg/L at 4 days and 0.41 mg/L at 4 weeks of age.

Average carvone concentrations in breastmilk were 2.5 mcg/L and 3.8 mcg/L on the first and last days of sampling, respectively. However, these values did not differ statistically, and the combined average carvone concentration was 3.2 mcg/L. A control group of 20 women who did not ingest d-carvone had no detectable carvone in their breastmilk.[9] Five women who were nursing infants between 6 and 55 weeks of age drank 950 mL of fennel-anise-caraway tea (Messmer Ostfriesische Tee Gesellschaft Laurens Spethmann GmbH &amp; Co.

Sixty-six postpartum mothers (22 in each of 3 groups) with no concurrent illnesses were randomly assigned to receive an herbal tea, placebo, or nothing after delivering healthy, fullterm infants. Mothers in the herbal tea group received at least 3 cups daily of 200 mL of Still Tea (Humana-Istanbul, Turkey; containing hibiscus 2.6 grams, fennel extract 200 mg, fennel oil 20 mg, rooibos 200 mg, verbena [vervain] 200 mg, raspberry leaves 200 mg, fenugreek 100 mg, goat's rue  100 mg, and, vitamin C 500 mg per 100 grams, per manufacturer's web site November 2011). A similar-looking apple tea was used as the placebo. All women were followed by the same nurse and pediatrician who were blinded to what treatment the mothers received. Mothers who received the Still Tea produced more breastmilk with an electric breast pump on the third day postpartum than mothers in the other groups. The infants in the Still Tea group had a lower maximum weight loss, and they regained their birth weights sooner than those in the placebo or no treatment arms. No long-term outcome data were collected. Because many of the ingredients in Still Tea are purported galactogogues, including fennel, no single ingredient can be considered solely responsible for the tea's effects, although the authors attributed the action to fengreek[24] An herbal tea containing fennel, fenugreek, hibiscus, rooibos, vervain, raspberry, goat's rue, and vitamin C (Humana Still-Tee, Humana GmbH, Herford, Germany) or water was randomly given to nursing mothers in a dosage of 3 cups daily beginning on the day of delivery. Several markers of antioxidant capacity were measured in breastmilk on day 1 and again after 7 to 10 days. No difference was found in the markers between mothers who received the tea and the water.[25] An uncontrolled, nonrandomized, nonblinded study in Iran enrolled 46 healthy nursing mothers between 18 and 35 years of age. At the start of the study, mothers were all nursing their infants and having no difficulty in doing so. The mothers' serum prolactin was measured in the morning before breakfast at least one hour after the previous nursing bout. Prolactin was measured before and after receiving powdered fennel in a dose of 3 grams daily by mouth for 15 days. The average baseline serum prolactin concentration was 64.6 mcg/L. The serum prolactin concentration after fennel therapy was 95.6 mcg/L. The difference was statistically significant. No measurements of milk production were made.[26] The prolactin level in a mother with established lactation may not affect her ability to breastfeed."

Fluoroquinolones have traditionally not been used in infants because of concern about adverse effects on the infants' developing joints. However, recent studies indicate little risk.[1][2] The calcium in milk might prevent absorption of the small amounts of fluoroquinolones in milk,[3] but insufficient data exist to prove or disprove this assertion. Short-term use of gemifloxacin is acceptable in nursing mothers with monitoring of the infant for possible effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea or candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

Then they pumped 1 to 4 milk samples at the time they perceived the smell of eucalyptus on their breath which had been previously shown to be approximately concurrent. A total of 21 milk samples were obtained. Odor was rated by a panel of 3 to 5 experts as either smelling like eucalyptus or not. Fourteen of the samples had a distinct eucalyptus-like odor. Chemical analysis of the positive odor tests found 1,8-cineole in concentrations from 70 to about 2090 mcg/kg of milk, most in the range of 100 to 500 mcg/kg of milk. Samples with negative odor tests contained concentrations in the range of 0.98 to about 20.23 mcg/kg of milk. In one woman who donated 3 samples, the highest concentration of 71 mcg/kg occurred at 1.5 hours after ingestion, with concentrations of 1 mcg/kg before ingestion and 15 mcg/kg at 9.5 hours after ingestion.[11] Eight women had their milk analyzed for 1,8-cineole metabolites.

Two mothers felt that their infants were more agitated a few hours after breastfeeding. A third mother reported that the infant stopped nursing from time to time and \"looked puzzled\", but resumed nursing. Upon repeating the experiment 6 weeks later, the infant did not react in an unusual way during breastfeeding.[11]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "In an old, uncontrolled, nonblinded case series, Agnus castus oligoplex (Madaus [Germany]) was used to increase lactation. One hundred twenty-five hospitalized postpartum mothers were given the product, which was obtained from the seed of the chaste tree, in a dosage of 30 drops 3 times a day. In cases with poor response the dose was increased to 30 and 50 drops a day. Of the 125 mothers, 100 responded and left the hospital nursing their infants. Of these, 61% nursed completely, and 39% only partially. Most of the latter were primiparous women or women who had not nursed their first child. The drug reportedly lost its effectiveness over time.[14] The methodology used in this paper does not meet current standards and cannot be considered as proof of a galactogogue effects of chasteberry. A nonrandomized, partially blinded study compared a chasteberry preparation (Agnolyt, Madaus [Germany]) 15 drops 3 times daily to one tablet of thiamine 3 times daily in postpartum mothers. Milk production was measured by the average change in weight of infants of 353 mothers treated with chasteberry, 102 cases were treated with thiamine, and 362 untreated patients served as controls. No difference in milk production was noted until about 14 days postpartum. After that time, the mothers who received chasteberry had greater milk production than those in the other groups. The effect appeared to be greater in patients with cesarean section or complications such as fever.[15] The methodology used in this study does not meet current standards and cannot be considered as proof of a galactogogue effects of chasteberry. A double-blind study of 52 women with hyperprolactinemia compared 20 mg daily of a chasteberry preparation (Strotan, Stroschein Pharma [Germany]) to placebo. After 3 months of therapy, the prolactin response to intravenous thyrotropin releasing hormone was reduced and menstrual irregularities were reduced in the subjects taking chasteberry.[16] In an open study of 20 healthy males, a special Agnus castus extract (BP1095E1, equivalent to 40 mg extract of chasteberry) was studied in doses of 120 mg, 240 mg and 480 mg daily in 3 divided doses. Each subject received placebo and each of the doses for 14 days, followed by 1 drug-free week. Total prolactin secretion was measured on the last day of each study period. Following stimulation by thyrotropin releasing hormone, the 120 mg dose increased serum prolactin by an average of about 16% and the 480 mg dose decreased prolactin by an average of about 10%; the 240 mg dose was approximately neutral with respect to placebo.[17] A randomized study compared chasteberry extract 40 mg daily (Agnucaston, Biomeks [Germany]) to bromocriptine 2.5 mg twice daily in 2 groups of 40 women. One group had mild hyperprolactinemia and the other had cyclic mastalgia. After 3 months of treatment, serum prolactin on day 3 to 5 of the menstrual cycle decreased by an average of 44% to 47% in all groups. No statistical difference was found between the 2 treatments in their prolactin-lowering effect.[18] An 18-year old woman with amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and an elevated serum prolactin caused by a microprolactinoma began taking 15 drops of a chasteberry preparation containing 9 grams of chasteberry tincture per 100 grams of solution (Agnolyt, Madaus [Germany]) each morning. After 3 months her menstrual cycle had normalized, galactorrhea had ceased, and serum prolactin had decreased by 27% (although still elevated).[19]"

    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Fifteen postpartum women who reported diminished lactation were given Ricalex (Aphali Pharmaceutical, Ltd., Ahmednegar, India) that contained 40 mg of a concentrated extract of wild asparagus, plus dicalcium phosphate 400 mg and 10 mg of  ash (suvarnamakshika bhasma). They took 2 tablets twice daily after meals. Eleven of the 15 women reported an increase in milk supply and 4 of these women reported a gradual decrease in milk supply after stopping the preparation and another increase after restarting.[1] Because of a lack of blinding, randomization, and placebo control, this study cannot be considered reliable.Forty women who complained of an insufficient milk supply at 5 days postpartum were given a combination herbal supplement as 2 capsules of Lactare (Pharma Private Ltd., Madras, India; currently available from TTK Pharma, Chennai, India) 3 times daily. Each capsule contained wild asparagus 200 mg, ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) 100 mg, fenugreek 50 mg, licorice 50 mg, and garlic 20 mg. By day 4 of therapy, no infants required supplementary feeding. Infants were weighed before and after each feeding on the fifth day of maternal therapy to determine the amount of milk ingested. On the day of the test weighing, infants' milk intake averaged 388 mL, and the fluid and caloric intake was considered adequate.[10] This study cannot be considered as valid evidence of a galactogogue effect of these herbs because it lacks randomization, blinding, a placebo control, and maternal instruction in breastfeeding technique. Additionally, infants were breastfed only 6 to 8 times daily, which is insufficient to maximize milk supply at this stage of lactation. Women who were between 14 and 90 days postpartum and reported lactation failure were given instructions on breastfeeding technique and encouraged to exclusively breastfeed. If their infant had gained less than 15 grams in 1 week, they were randomized to receive either two tablespoonfuls of a mixture containing wild asparagus or an identical placebo for 4 weeks. In each 100 grams, the mixture contained Asparagus racemosus 15 grams, Anethum soiva 1 gram, Ipomea digitata 1 gram, Glycyrrhiza glabra 1 gram, Spinacia oleracea  2.5 grams, Cuminum cyminum 0.5 gram, and Panchatrinamol 1 gram. Of the 64 women randomized, 11 did not complete the trial. Serum prolactin measurements were made before a morning nursing before treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment. Infant weight gains and the number of supplemental feedings were recorded initially and after 4 weeks of therapy. No differences were found in the changes in serum prolactin, infant weight gain or amount of supplementation between the treatment and placebo groups after 4 weeks of therapy. No side effects or changes in liver function tests occurred during the study.[11]Sixty nursing mothers were randomized to receive either the fresh roots of Asparagus racemosus (verified by botanists) 20 mg/kg 3 times daily or placebo rice powder 3 times daily for 30 days. Women were chosen for the study if they reported diminished milk supply, their infant crying after feeding, breast pain during lactation, maternal loss of appetite, or anxiety disorder. Infants averaged 2.8 months. Women and infants were examined weekly. Mothers who received the active herb had a 33% increase in serum prolactin over baseline compared to a 10% increase in the women who received placebo. The paper does not state when prolactin levels were measured either during the 30-day period or in relation to nursing. Infant weights increased more in the treatment group (16% vs 6%), and treated mothers rated their satisfaction and their infants' happiness greater than those in the placebo group. No side effects were noted in the paper.[12] The nonuniform composition of the mothers' complaints and the lack of optimizing nursing technique before the study detract from an otherwise well-conducted trial."

Then they pumped 1 to 4 milk samples at the time they perceived the smell of eucalyptus on their breath which had been previously shown to be approximately concurrent. A total of 21 milk samples were obtained. Odor was rated by a panel of 3 to 5 experts as either smelling like eucalyptus or not. Fourteen of the samples had a distinct eucalyptus-like odor. Chemical analysis of the positive odor tests found 1,8-cineole in concentrations from 70 to about 2090 mcg/kg of milk, most in the range of 100 to 500 mcg/kg of milk. Samples with negative odor tests contained concentrations in the range of 0.98 to about 20.23 mcg/kg of milk.

The parents reported restlessness and vomiting during the past day. One of the mothers also reported feeling drowsy and weak. On examination, the infants were afebrile but had hypotonia, lethargy, emesis, weak cry, poor sucking and weak responses to painful stimuli. Infant laboratory values, electrocardiograms and blood pressures were normal, and septic work-ups were negative. Both mothers had both been drinking more than 2 liters daily of an herbal tea mixture reportedly containing licorice, fennel, anise, and goat's rue to stimulate lactation. After the mothers discontinued breastfeeding and the herbal tea, the infants improved within 24 to 36 hours. Symptoms of the affected mother also resolved rapidly after discontinuing the herbal tea. After 2 days, breastfeeding was reinstituted with no further symptoms in the infants. Both infants were doing well at 6 months of age. The authors attributed the maternal and infant symptoms to anethole, which is found in both anise and fennel, but not goat's rue; however, the anethole levels were not measured in breastmilk, nor were the teas tested for their content.[7]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A group of 5 nursing mothers were given no herb for 5 days, 15 mL of a 5% of goat's rue infusion orally 3 times daily for 10 days, followed by another 5-day control period from days 15 to 20. Their diet and environment were kept constant during the study period. Milk volume was measured daily and milk fat percentage was measured on days 5, 10, 15 and 20. The goat's rue had no effect on milk volume or fat content.[8] Because of the lack of randomization, blinding and controls, and small number of participants, no valid conclusion can be made from this study on the galactogogue effects of goat's rue. Goat's rue extract (Galegran, Rieswerke, [Graz, Austria]) was given in an unspecified dose to increase the milk supply in an old, uncontrolled observational study of 336 women whose milk production was thought to be lower than normal. Increased milk output of 30 to 60% was observed.[9] Because of the lack of randomization, breastfeeding support, and placebo control  no valid conclusion can be made from this study on the galactogogue effects of goat's rue. In another old study that was not blinded, randomized or placebo controlled, goat's rue extract (Galegran, Rieswerke, [Graz, Austria]) was given in an unspecified dose to 50 postpartum women from the third to fifth days postpartum. Fifty untreated women were used as comparators. The milk output increased by 75% in the untreated women and by 125% in the treated women, but the volumes of milk were spread over wide ranges. Also, the quality of milk was determined based on the dry weight values of fat, protein and lactose in another 100 women (50 treated and 50 untreated). The increase in milk resulted in a proportional increase in the tested components; however, the differences were all in the normal range and not statistically significant.[10] Similar to the above study, no valid conclusion can be made from this study on the galactogogue effects of goat's rue.Sixty-six postpartum mothers (22 in each of 3 groups) with no concurrent illnesses were randomly assigned to receive an herbal tea, placebo, or nothing after delivering healthy, fullterm infants. Mothers in the herbal tea group received at least 3 cups daily of 200 mL of Still Tea (Humana-Istanbul, Turkey; containing hibiscus  2.6 grams, fennel extract 200 mg, fennel oil 20 mg, rooibos 200 mg, verbena [vervain] 200 mg, raspberry leaves 200 mg, fenugreek 100 mg, goat's rue  100 mg, and, vitamin C 500 mg per 100 grams, per manufacturer's web site November 2011). A similar-looking apple tea was used as the placebo. All women were followed by the same nurse and pediatrician who were blinded to what treatment the mothers received. Mothers who received the Still Tea produced more breastmilk with an electric breast pump on the third day postpartum than mothers in the other groups. The infants in the Still Tea group had a lower maximum weight loss, and they regained their birth weights sooner than those in the placebo or no treatment arms. No long-term outcome data were collected. Because many of the ingredients in Still Tea are purported galactogogues, including goat's rue, no single ingredient can be considered solely responsible for the tea's effects, although the authors attributed the action to fenugreek.[11] An herbal tea containing goat's rue, fenugreek, hibiscus, fennel, rooibos, vervain, raspberry, and vitamin C (Humana Still-Tee, Humana GmbH, Herford, Germany) or water was randomly given to nursing mothers in a dosage of 3 cups daily beginning on the day of delivery. Several markers of antioxidant capacity were measured in breastmilk on day 1 and again after 7 to 10 days. No difference was found in the markers between mothers who received the tea and the water.[12]"

Resolution of the reaction took about 5 days. A second, milder reaction occurred in the same areas of the infant's face 2 months later when his mother ingested a squid dish mildly flavored with red pepper. The authors report discussions with two physicians from Korea who stated that these types of reactions are seen occasionally and well known in Korea. They stated that the reactions usually start about 12 hours after nursing and persist for 24 to 48 hours for mild reactions and up to 10 days for more severe reactions.

On examination, the infants were afebrile but had hypotonia, lethargy, emesis, weak cry, poor sucking and weak responses to painful stimuli. Infant laboratory values, electrocardiograms and blood pressures were normal, and septic work-ups were negative. Both mothers had both been drinking more than 2 liters daily of an herbal tea mixture reportedly containing licorice, fennel, anise, and goat's rue to stimulate lactation. After the mothers discontinued breastfeeding and the herbal tea, the infants improved within 24 to 36 hours. Symptoms of the affected mother also resolved rapidly after discontinuing the herbal tea. After 2 days, breastfeeding was reinstituted with no further symptoms in the infants. Both infants were doing well at 6 months of age. The authors attributed the maternal and infant symptoms to anethole, which is found in both anise and fennel; however, the anethole levels were not measured in breastmilk, nor were the teas tested for their content.[4]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A woman with a history of excessive licorice intake had amenorrhea, severe headaches, hypertension, hypokalemia. She had elevated serum prolactin levels that remained abnormal for one month after licorice discontinuation and normalized by 6 months after discontinuation.[6] In a study of 25 men and 25 women, the baseline and thyrotropin-stimulated serum prolactin levels were measured to determine normal serum prolactin values. Subjects who regularly ingested licorice had lower basal and lower stimulated serum prolactin concentrations.[1] A traditional, nonstandardized decoction of peony and licorice roots called Shaoyao-Gancao-Tang in Chinese and Shakuyaku-Kanzo-To in Japanese was studied in women with elevated serum prolactin caused by long-term (  > 6 months) ingestion of risperidone. Patients received either bromocriptine 5 mg daily for 4 weeks followed by 4 weeks of 22.5 grams daily of the peony-licorice decoction (equivalent to 25 mg of glycyrrhetinic acid), or the same drugs in the reverse order. Evaluation of serum prolactin found that both treatments reduced serum prolactin by 21 to 28% from baseline at 4 and 8 weeks.[7]Forty women who complained of an insufficient milk supply at 5 days postpartum were given a combination herbal supplement as 2 capsules of Lactare (Pharma Private Ltd. [Madras, India]; currently available from TTK Pharma [Chennai, India]) 3 times daily. Each capsule contained wild asparagus 200 mg, ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) 100 mg, fenugreek 50 mg, licorice 50 mg, and garlic 20 mg. By day 4 of therapy, no infants required supplementary feeding. Infants were weighed before and after each feeding on the fifth day of maternal therapy to determine the amount of milk ingested. On the day of the test weighing, infants' milk intake averaged 388 mL, and the fluid and caloric intake was considered adequate.[8] This study cannot be considered as valid evidence of a galactogogue effect of these herbs because it lacks randomization, blinding, a placebo control, and maternal instruction in breastfeeding technique. Additionally, infants were breastfed only 6 to 8 times daily, which is insufficient to maximize milk supply at this stage of lactation.Women who were between 14 and 90 days postpartum and reported lactation failure were given instructions on breastfeeding technique and encouraged to exclusively breastfeed. If their infant had gained less than 15 grams in 1 week, they were randomized to receive either two tablespoonfuls of a mixture containing wild asparagus or an identical placebo for 4 weeks. In each 100 grams, the mixture contained Asparagus racemosus 15 grams, Anethum soiva 1 gram, Ipomea digitata 1 gram, Glycyrrhiza glabra 1 gram, Spinacia oleracea  2.5 grams, Cuminum cyminum 0.5 gram, and Panchatrinamol 1 gram. Of the 64 women randomized, 11 did not complete the trial. Serum prolactin measurements were made before a morning nursing before treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment. Infant weight gains and the number of supplemental feedings were recorded initially and after 4 weeks of therapy. No differences were found in the changes in serum prolactin, infant weight gain or amount of supplementation between the treatment and placebo groups after 4 weeks of therapy.

Turmeric is \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) as a food ingredient by the US Food and Drug Administration. Turmeric is generally well tolerated even in high doses, but gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and diarrhea, and rare allergic reactions have been reported, and  it may increase the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin and antiplatelet drugs. Because of a lack of data, turmeric in amounts higher than those found in foods as a flavoring should probably be avoided during breastfeeding.

Cream was applied to the affected breast 3 times daily for 3 days. Mastitis improved in both groups, but the improvement was greater in the group that received the curcumin cream.[6] The authors claimed that the study was double-blinded; however, curcumin has a bright yellow color, and no mention was made of the color of the placebo cream. This difference may have negated the blinding of the study. Studies of Thai herbal compresses containing ginger, turmeric and camphor have evaluated the effect of application of the compresses to the breasts on lactation. The studies showed that the compresses shortened the time to lactation postpartum compared to routine clinical care for enhancing lactation.[3]"

Maternal Levels: Eighteen lactating women were given 100 mg of l-menthol in a capsule on 3 test days. Milk samples were collected every 2 hours for 8 hours starting at the time of ingestion. Menthol was detected in milk at all collection times, with the average concentrations of 2.1 mcg/L at 0 hours, 4.9 mcg/L at 2 hours, 5.9 mcg/L at 4 hours, 5.8 mcg/L at 6 hours and 4.1 mcg/L at 8 hours after the dose. The average peak menthol concentration in milk was 8 mcg/L. Only small amounts of menthol glucuronide metabolites were present in the milk samples.[7] Maternal Levels: Twelve nursing mothers who were19 weeks to 19 months postpartum ingested 100 mg of 1,8 cineole (eucalyptol) in the form of delayed-release capsules (Soledum-Klosterfrau Vertriebs GmbH, Germany) that release the drug in the intestine. Then they pumped 1 to 4 milk samples at the time they perceived the smell of eucalyptus on their breath which had been previously shown to be approximately concurrent. A total of 21 milk samples were obtained. Odor was rated by a panel of 3 to 5 experts as either smelling like eucalyptus or not. Fourteen of the samples had a distinct eucalyptus-like odor. Chemical analysis of the positive odor tests found 1,8-cineole in concentrations from 70 to about 2090 mcg/kg of milk, most in the range of 100 to 500 mcg/kg of milk. Samples with negative odor tests contained concentrations in the range of 0.98 to about 20.23 mcg/kg of milk. In one woman who donated 3 samples, the highest concentration of 71 mcg/kg occurred at 1.5 hours after ingestion, with concentrations of 1 mcg/kg before ingestion and 15 mcg/kg at 9.5 hours after ingestion.[8] Eight women had their milk analyzed for 1,8-cineole metabolites.

A study of 50 Korean postpartum mothers measured the amount of iodine in their breastmilk. At 2 to 5 days postpartum, iodine content averaged 2170 mcg/L (range 218 to 8671 mcg/L) or 2.7 mg daily. At 4 weeks postpartum when the seaweed intake was less, iodine averaged 892 mcg/L (range 60 to 3838 mg/L) or 1.3 mg daily.[6] The breastmilk of the mothers of 31 preterm Korean infants was measured for iodine concentration on week 1, 3 and 6 postpartum. Korean mothers often have elevated iodine levels from large amounts of dietary iodine in brown seaweed soup during the first month postpartum. Median breastmilk iodine levels were 2529, 1153 and 822 mcg/L at the 3 times, respectively.[7] Infant Levels: The preterm infants of Korean mothers with high levels of breastmilk iodine had relatively high urinary iodine levels that were thought to be related to high maternal intake of iodine from seaweed soup.[7]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Limited information indicates that maternal doses of clobazam up to 30 mg daily produce low levels in milk. Short-term use would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants, especially if the infant is older than 2 months.

    drug_levels: "Clobazam has a half-life of 36 to 42 hours and is metabolized to N-desmethylclobazam, which has about 20% of the activity of clobazam and a half-life of 71 to 82 hours. Maternal Levels: In an older, unpublished study performed by the European manufacturer, clobazam and N-desmethylclobazam were measured in breastmilk using an assay that did not distinguish between the two compounds. Six patients received oral clobazam 10 mg at 7 am and 20 mg at 3 pm daily for 5 days. Milk samples were taken 2 hours after each dose on days 2 and 5 of drug administration. Average clobazam plus N-desmethylclobazam milk levels were 0.125 mg/L on day 2 and 0.152 mg/L on day 5. The highest recorded clobazam plus N-desmethylclobazam milk levels were 0.33 mg/L on day 2 and 0.25 mg/L on day 5. The weight-adjusted infant dosages are an average of 4.6% of the maternal dosage and a maximum of 7.5% of the maternal dosage.[3] Because of the lower potency and longer half-life of N-desmethylclobazam, these values probably overestimate the pharmacologic impact of clobazam in breastmilk.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Melatonin is a normal component of human milk which is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Ten nursing mothers who were 3 to 5 days postpartum had serum and breastmilk melatonin levels measured between 2 pm and 5 pm and again between 2 am and 4 am. The breastmilk melatonin level averaged 23 ng/L at night, an average of 35% of the maternal serum concentration. Melatonin was undetectable (  < 10 ng/L) in milk during the daytime. Six of the mothers collected milk after each feeding for 24 hours once within 3 months of delivery. All mothers exhibited a marked circadian rhythm of melatonin excretion into breastmilk with detectable levels first occurring in the evening and dropping to undetectable levels in the morning.[5] Twenty-four healthy mothers and 24 mothers with allergic eczema were studied in a crossover fashion to watch either a humorous video, a nonhumorous video, or no video at 2-week intervals. Melatonin was measured in breastmilk 5 times between 10 pm and 6 am. Melatonin levels were higher at all times in the mothers who had watched the humorous video. The melatonin levels in mothers with eczema were generally lower than in normal mothers, but had a greater increase to similar levels in both groups after viewing the humorous video. The highest milk melatonin levels occurred at the 2 am sampling in all phases of the study, with a peak of 20.8 ng/L in healthy mothers and 19.9 ng/L in those with eczema.[6] In studies in which exogenous oral melatonin was given to women, the resulting serum melatonin was variable, but peak serum concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 2.6 mcg/L for each 1 mg administered.[7][8][9] This would result in an average increase in breastmilk melatonin concentration from 0.4 to 1 mcg/L for each 1 mg administered to the mother, based on an average milk concentration of 35% of the maternal serum concentration. While the resulting concentrations would be higher than the typical physiologic peak milk concentrations of 0.02 mcg/L,[5][6] it would present a considerably lower dose to the infant than the 10 mg/kg dosages of melatonin that have been safely administered to neonates in clinical studies.[3][4] One study found that breastmilk melatonin concentration was inversely correlated with breastmilk prolactin concentration and was higher in women experiencing fatigue in the morning.[10] Five nursing mothers provided breastmilk samples every 2 hours over a 24-hour period. Melatonin was undetectable during the day, but began to rise at about 8 pm, reaching a peak at about 3 am, and then declining.[2]Thirty women who were 48 to 72 hours postpartum provided 2 colostrum samples, one at noon and one at midnight. Melatonin levels in colostrum averaged about 16 ng/L at noon and 36 ng/L at midnight.[3] Infant Levels: A study of 8 breastfed and 6 formula-fed infants found different patterns of the melatonin metabolite, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, in their urine. Breastfed infants had a sinusoidal excretion pattern with a peak at 6 am and a trough at 6 pm. Formula-fed infants had a simple increase in the metabolite that was at baseline between about 8 pm and 4 am with a peak at about noon.[12]"

Glucosamine sulfate has no specific lactation-related uses. It is most commonly used to treat osteoarthritis. A glucosamine derivative, N-acetylglucosamine, is a normal component of human breastmilk. Glucosamine sulfate is well tolerated with occasional gastrointestinal discomfort (e.g., diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, vomiting) reported. Although no studies exist on the use of glucosamine sulfate during breastfeeding, its use by a nursing mother is unlikely to adversely affect the breastfed infant.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Levocarnitine and acetyl-l-carnitine (acetlycarnitine) are normal components of human milk that are required for fat metabolism. The body can use only levocarnitine, and dextrocarnitine can be an antagonist of levocarnitine. Acetyl-l-carnitine, and propionyl-l-carnitine can be converted to levocarnitine by the body. The bioavailability of levocarnitine is less than 20%, but acetylcarnitine and propionlycarnitine may be higher. These substances have no specific lactation-related uses. Within the normal range of dietary intake, excretion of levocarnitine into breastmilk is relatively constant. Women with carnitine deficiency appear to secrete insufficient amounts of carnitine into their breastmilk for their breastfed infants, who may require levocarnitine supplementation.[1] Preterm infants are often deficient in levocarnitine and require supplementation.[2] No data exist on the safety and efficacy levocarnitine supplementation in nursing mothers or infants without carnitine deficiency. Levocarnitine and its derivatives are generally well tolerated in adults with occasional gastrointestinal upset and restlessness. A fishy odor to the breath, sweat and urine has been reported. Although data are very limited, poor bioavailability might limit absorption by the breastfed infant. It appears unlikely that maternal levocarnitine supplements during nursing would be harmful to the infant, but until more data are available, it is probably best to avoid levocarnitine supplementation unless it is prescribed by a healthcare professional.<br><br>  Pasteurization (method not stated) had little effect on the concentration of endogenous carnitine in one study. Pasteurization followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees C for 48 hours reduced the carnitine concentration by about 13%.[3]"

Maternal Levels: A woman diagnosed with carnitine uptake deficiency following the birth of her infant was given oral carnitine 500 mg 3 times daily. This dose failed to increase her breastmilk carnitine concentration, with a persistently low concentration of 3.4 mg/L (21 micromoles/L) before supplementation and after 18 days of supplementation.[1]The carnitine concentration was measured in the breastmilk of 27 normal mothers who were not taking carnitine as a supplement. Average carnitine concentrations were 10.1 mg/L over the first 21 days postpartum, which was higher than the maternal serum concentration. The concentration decreased by about 50% by postpartum days 40 to 50. No difference in concentration was found between fore- and hindmilk.[3] Another study in normal mothers found a similar average carnitine concentration of 10.6 mg/L.[5] In a study that followed 37 healthy, nonsmoking mothers who were not taking carnitine as a supplement, carnitine and acetylcarnitine in breastmilk were measured over time. Immediately postpartum, the average milk carnitine concentration was 12.6 mg/L and acetylcarnitine was 5.7 mg/L. From 2 months postpartum to 12 months postpartum, carnitine and acetylcarnitine milk concentrations were lower, in the range of 6.1 to 8.9 mg/L for carnitine and 1.2 to 2 mg/L for acetylcarnitine.[6] Ten mothers of fullterm infants and mothers of preterm infants (36 weeks gestation or less) provided blood and milk samples for measurement of carnitine at 4 times during the first month postpartum. None were taking carnitine as a supplement. In the mothers of fullterm infants, total breastmilk carnitine averaged 11.7 mg/L at 2 to 3 days postpartum, 11.8 mg/L at 5 to 7 days postpartum, 11.3 mg/L at 2 weeks postpartum, and 10.5 mg/L at 4 weeks postpartum. About one-third to one-half of the carnitine was free carnitine and the remainder was acetylcarnitine. Breastmilk concentrations were about 50 to 100% greater than simultaneous plasma concentrations. The mothers of preterm infants had higher breastmilk carnitine levels, averaging about 12 mg/L throughout the first month postpartum.[7] Carnitine and acetylcarnitine were measured in the breastmilk of 14 lactating women who were 1 to 10 months postpartum and not taking carnitine as a supplement. The average milk concentration of free carnitine was 5.9 mg/L and of total carnitine was 7.2 mg/L. Maternal dietary intake of carnitine had no effect on breastmilk carnitine concentrations. The authors estimated that an exclusively breastfed infant would receive about 6 mg daily of carnitine from breastmilk.[8] Infant Levels.

Mothers in the herbal tea group received at least 3 cups daily of 200 mL of Still Tea (Humana-Istanbul, Turkey; containing hibiscus 2.6 grams, fennel extract 200 mg, fennel oil 20 mg, rooibos 200 mg, verbena [vervain] 200 mg, raspberry leaves 200 mg, fenugreek 100 mg, goat's rue 100 mg, and, vitamin C 500 mg per 100 grams, per manufacturer's web site November 2011). A similar-looking apple tea was used as the placebo. All women were followed by the same nurse and pediatrician who were blinded to what treatment the mothers received. Mothers who received the Still Tea produced more breastmilk with an electric breast pump on the third day postpartum than mothers in the other groups. The infants in the Still Tea group had a lower maximum weight loss, and they regained their birth weights sooner than those in the placebo or no treatment arms. No long-term outcome data were collected. Because many of the ingredients in Still Tea are purported galactogogues, including hibiscus, no single ingredient can be considered solely responsible for the tea's effects, although the authors attributed the action to fenugreek.[3]An herbal tea containing hibiscus, fenugreek, fennel, rooibos, vervain, raspberry, goat's rue, and vitamin C (Humana Still-Tee, Humana GmbH, Herford, Germany) or water was randomly given to nursing mothers in a dosage of 3 cups daily beginning on the day of delivery. Several markers of antioxidant capacity were measured in breastmilk on day 1 and again after 7 to 10 days. No difference was found in the markers between mothers who received the tea and the water.[4]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Small amounts of mineral oil can be found in breastmilk, apparently from absorption of hydrocarbons from cosmetics over long periods of time. Because mineral oil is poorly absorbed orally, little or none will not reach the bloodstream of the infant or cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants.[1] One small study supports the lack of effect of maternal mineral oil on the bowels of their  breastfed infants. Oral use of mineral oil by the nursing mother is acceptable, although repeated use should be avoided because it may cause a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. The use of mineral oil or ointments containing mineral oil on or near the breast may expose the infant to high levels of mineral paraffins via licking.[2] Only water-miscible cream products should be applied to the breast."

The mean hydrocarbon content of milk fat on day 4 was 55 mg/kg of fat and on day 20 it was 15 mg/kg of fat. The amount in milk fat was correlated with the amount in subcutaneous fat.

    drug_levels: "Milk levels have not been measured after maternal ingestion of salsalate, but have been measured after other salicylates, such as aspirin and sodium salicylate. All of these products result in salicylic acid in the blood and milk; however, some studies have not measured salicylate metabolites in breastmilk that may be hydrolyzed in the infant's gut and absorbed as salicylate.[1] Maternal Levels: Milk and blood levels of the salicylate metabolites of aspirin were determined in 8 lactating women following oral administration of 1 g of aspirin. Peak salicylic acid milk levels averaging 2.4 mg/L occurred 3 hours after the dose. Milk contents of salicyluric acid were greater than those of salicylic acid; a mean peak level of 10.2 mg/L was reached after 9 hours, and averaged 4.4 mg/L 24 hours after the dose. Total salicylate and metabolite levels were 5.1 mg/L at 3 hours, 9.9 mg/L at 6 hours, 11.2 mg/L at 9 hours and 10.2 mg/L at 12 hours after the dose. Acid labile conjugates were less than 0.2 mg/L.[2] Using an average salicylate plus salicylurate level over the first 12 hours, a fully breastfed infant would receive an average of 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Six nursing mothers who were 2 to 8 months postpartum (average 5 months) were given aspirin doses of 500, 1000 and 1500 mg of aspirin orally on 3 separate occasions. Peak breastmilk salicylate levels were 5.8 mg/L, 15.8 mg/L, and 38.8 mg/L, respectively. Salicylate metabolites were not measured. The time of the peak salicylate levels occurred between 2 and 6 hours after ingestion, with little variation in levels over time. The disproportionate increase in milk levels as the dose increased was attributed to nonlinear metabolism and protein binding.[3]Two women given aspirin 454 mg orally had peak salicylate milk levels of about 1 mg/L 1 hour after the dose. The authors estimated that about 0.1% of the mothers' total dose would appear in breastmilk in 48 hours.[4] However, salicylate metabolites were not measured in milk. A woman who was breastfeeding a 4-month-old was taking long-term aspirin therapy in dosages ranging from 2 to 5.9 g daily. During this therapy, milk was obtained 4 hours after a 650 mg dose and just before taking a dose of 975 mg. The trough milk salicylate level was 2 mg/L and a peak level of 10 mg/L occurred 3 hours after the dose. Salicylate levels ranged from 4 to 7 mg/L over the 5 hours after the peak.[5] Using the peak level from this study, a fully breastfed infant would receive about 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of salicylate. The assay method used should have measured both salicylate and metabolites in milk. Infant Levels: Four nursing mothers were given oral sodium salicylate in a dose of 20 mg/kg. Their exclusively breastfed infants ranged from 23 to 43 days of age. The infants' urine was collected until salicylate excretion was complete and found to contain 0.18 to 0.36% of the maternal dose, primarily as salicyluric acid.[1] A 9-week-old infant who was born at 36 weeks gestation was receiving about 50% breastmilk and 50% formula.

In one study, acupuncture did not affect prolactin hyperresponsiveness after stimulation with metoclopramide in women with amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome. Galactorrhea has been reported following acupuncture for pain treatment.<br><br>  Acupuncture has been well described in TCM for treating insufficient milk supply,[1][2] and is also recommended in some Western countries.[3] Numerous studies found acupuncture at CV 17 (also referred to as Ren 17 or Shanzong; located at the center of the sternum), SI 1 (Shaoze; on the little finger), and ST 18 (Rugen; lower breast margins) to benefit women with a low postpartum milk supply. These studies generally do not meet current evidence-based guidelines, partly because of the extreme difficulty in double-blinding and placebo-controlling acupuncture studies. However, 2 studies did find a better response to electroacupuncture applied at a traditional site for lactation stimulation (SI 1) than electroacupuncture applied at a site unrelated to milk production (LI 1). None of the studies reported to date have made an attempt to optimize maternal nursing technique before acupuncture. Galactogogues should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors that affect milk production.[4]<br><br>Acupuncture therapy has been used to treat breastfeeding for milk stasis (engorgement). Randomized, nonblinded studies in an outpatient Swedish lactation clinic compared routine care to routine care plus acupuncture at 2 or 3 points for treating milk stasis. The groups that received acupuncture had a slightly more rapid resolution of symptoms than those who did not.[5][6] A meta-analysis concluded that these studies were not large enough to detect differences in relevant clinical outcomes such as mastitis.[7] A survey of 50 Swedish maternity units in 2007 found that 60% of hospitals used acupuncture to treat milk stasis, 18% used acupuncture to treat mastitis, and 2.2% each used it for painful breastfeeding or to improve milk supply. The authors felt that this extensive use was not justified based on the limited evidence for most of these uses.[8]"

    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "Galactorrhea has been reported after acupuncture for pain treatment in 2 women who had previously breastfed, but were not currently breastfeeding.[9][10] In a Polish study, 8 women who had galactorrhea for 2 to 9 years after delivery were given metoclopramide as a diagnostic agent before and after acupuncture. After a 10 mg oral dose of metoclopramide, serum prolactin was measured within the first hour after the dose and at 2 hours after the dose. Women were divided into 2 groups. All women had normal baseline serum prolactin levels, but were hyperresponsive to metoclopramide, with average prolactin elevations of 760% and 926% in the two groups. The women underwent 10 sessions of acupuncture, with each group receiving acupuncture at different points thought to reduce hyperlactation. Although galactorrhea resolved in 1 woman and improved in 3 others, no difference was noted in the prolactin response to metoclopramide stimulation. The authors interpreted this finding to indicate that acupuncture's effect on galactorrhea is not mediated via prolactin secretion.[11]An uncontrolled case series on 27 women in Romania who reported insufficient lactation following delivery were given acupuncture, but no instructions on proper breastfeeding techniques. The main acupuncture points were CV 17, SI 1, and ST 18, with some women receiving treatment at additional TCM points. Acupuncture was done daily until milk supply improved, then every 2 to 3 days. No blinding or controls were attempted. Improvement was rated as good in 19 women, satisfactory in 8 women and no response in 4 women. Women who responded required 2 to 7 sessions, while nonresponders received up to 10 sessions. Primiparous women responded with fewer sessions than multiparous women.[12] An uncontrolled case series from one Chinese hospital reported on 30 women who had insufficient postpartum milk supply and were treated with acupuncture at the CV 17, SI 1, and ST 18 primary sites, with supplementary treatment at ST 36 (Zusanli; middle of shin) and LR 3 (Taichong; dorsal foot near big toe). No instructions on proper breastfeeding techniques were provided. Most reportedly improved to some degree with one treatment and markedly improved with 3 to 5 treatments, especially if treated within 10 days of delivery.[13] A multicenter, randomized, single-blind clinical trial in China compared breast fullness, amount of milk produced, TCM symptom score, and prolactin levels in two groups of 138 patients. No instructions on proper breastfeeding techniques were reported. One group received electroacupuncture (EA) at the SI 1 site and the control group received EA at the LI 1 site. The percentage of women rated as clinically \"cured\" or \"markedly improved\" was 98% in the treatment group and 24% in the control group, which was a statistically significant difference. The TCM score, breast fullness, milk production and prolactin levels were also reportedly better in the group treated at SI 1.[14]A multicenter, single-blind clinical trial in China compared breast fullness, amount of milk produced, neonatal body weight, artificial feeding frequency and volume, urination frequency and crying time of neonates in 276 women randomized to receive either acupuncture at CV 17 or a traditional herbal galactogogue mixture (Tongre Decoction). No instructions on proper breastfeeding techniques or other support were reported. The endpoints were improved in the two groups, with no significant difference between the two groups.[15] In a Chinese study, women reporting lactation insufficiency were randomized to receive electroacupuncture bilaterally at the SI 1 site (n = 46) or the LI 1 site (n = 46). Women received a total to 10 treatments. The 24-hour milk volumes and morning serum prolactin levels were measured before and after the treatment course. At the end of therapy, all women receiving acupuncture at the SI 1 site had improved milk volumes compared to 70% at the LI 1 site. Serum prolactin was unchanged from baseline in the treatment group, but was lower at the end of the study in the control group.[16]A study in Italy randomized women with insufficient milk supply postpartum to receive either acupuncture (n = 41) or routine observation (n = 43). The main acupuncture points were CV 17, SI 1, and ST 18 with some women receiving treatment at additional points, based on TCM diagnoses. Women received a total of 6 treatments over 2 weeks. Before therapy, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding was similar in the 2 groups at about 50%. By 3 weeks after study enrollment, the rate in the observation group was lower (60%) than in the acupuncture group (98%). At 3 months of age, exclusive breastfeeding was 15% in the observation group and 35% in the treated group.[17] A nonrandomized trial in China used acupuncture at the neiguan and yang chi points to treat engorgement in 40 patients. After treatment, breast tenderness and swelling and milk output were all improved to a statistically significant degree.[18] A randomized, nonblinded study in Iran compared maternal breastfeeding education to acupressure among women referred for hypogalactia. At 2 and 4 weeks after initiation, both groups had increased milk output, but the volumes of milk were greater in the acupressure group than in the education group.[19]"

A poultice of raw carrots applied to the breast has been used to treat uncomplicated breast engorgement during breastfeeding;[1][2] however, as with topical cabbage leaves, evidence of efficacy is lacking because engorgement tends to improve over time regardless of treatment.[3] Both beta-carotene and carrot flavor are transmitted into breastmilk. Carrot intake can improve maternal and breastmilk beta-carotene and vitamin A status,[4][5] but excessive maternal intake of carrots can lead to a harmless, reversible discoloration of the breastfed infant's skin. Exposure to carrot flavor in breastmilk can improve the future acceptance of carrots by the infant."

The consensus of a panel was that the odor of carrots was strongest 2 hours after ingesting the carrot juice. The mothers were presented with timed samples of their own breastmilk and judged that the taste of carrot was strongest at 3 hours after carrot juice ingestion.[10] A study of 15 women given an unspecified quantity of fresh carrot paste containing 15 mg of all-trans-beta-carotene with a high-fat meal daily for 3 days. Measurements of breastmilk carotene before, during and after the trial showed an increase in beta-carotene breastmilk levels.

    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A nursing mother was eating 2 to 3 pounds of carrots a week as raw and cooked carrots. The mother's skin was yellow in color, but her sclera were clear. At 2 months of age, her breastfed infant was diagnosed as having jaundice because of a yellow coloration of the skin. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the infant's skin returned to a normal color. The mother continued her diet and examination of the maternal serum found elevated levels of beta-carotene which was probably the cause of her infant's skin discoloration.[12] Nursing mothers ingested either 300 mL of carrot juice (n = 20) or water (n = 18) 2 to 3 hours before nursing daily for a week. Their infants were then tested for their acceptance of cereal prepared with either carrot juice or water. The infants who had been exposed to carrots in breastmilk consumed less flavored cereal relative to plain cereal than the control infants and they spent less time feeding. The authors interpreted these results to be a form of sensory-specific satiety in which the infants become less responsive to a flavor that they have been extensively exposed to in the very recent past.[10]Seventeen nursing mothers were given 300 mL of carrot juice or water for 4 days per week for 3 consecutive weeks during the first 2 months of lactation. Other study groups received carrot juice during the last trimester of pregnancy or water during pregnancy and breastfeeding as a placebo. At a mean of 5.6 months postpartum, the infants were tested twice, once with cereal prepared with carrot juice and once with cereal prepared with water. Infants whose mothers received carrot juice during lactation scored higher on measures of acceptance of carrot-flavored cereal and took in more cereal than those whose mothers received water, but the latter difference did not reach statistical significance. These effects were similar, but stronger among infants exposed prenatally.[13]"

Maternal Levels: Five nursing mothers were supplemented with fish oil containing 1080 mg of EPA and 720 mg of DHA daily for 21 days, beginning at 2 weeks postpartum. Milk samples were collected daily before the dose; once weekly, milk samples were also collected at 4, 8, 12 and 16 hours after the dose. On day 21, predose milk levels of DHA (by 89%), EPA (by 525%) and another omega-3 fatty acid (docosapentaenoic acid; by 143%) were significantly increased over their initial levels. Mean and peak levels increased each week during the study on each of the days were sequential levels were measured. Peak omega-3 fatty acid levels occurred 12 hours after ingestion.[7] New mothers intending to breastfeed for at least 12 weeks were randomized to receive placebo (n = 12) or algal-derived DHA in a dose of 0.2 (n = 10), 0.4 (n = 12), 0.9 (n = 10) or 1.3 (n = 8) grams daily starting at day 5 postpartum. At 12 weeks postpartum, DHA levels in breastmilk were linearly proportional to the dose of DHA ingested, expressed as the following percentages of total breastmilk fatty acids: 0.21% (placebo),  0.35% (0.2 grams), 0.46% (0.4 grams), 0.86% (0.9 grams), and 1.13% (1.3 grams).[8] Mothers who were breastfeeding at least 75% were randomized to receive supplements of either high-DHA algal oil (n = 6), high-DHA eggs (n = 6), low EPA fish oil (n = 6) or regular eggs (n = 6) beginning at 2 weeks postpartum. Supplementation provided doses of   <  230 mg, 170 mg, 260 mg and   < 35 mg daily of DHA, respectively. After 6 weeks of supplementation, breastmilk DHA was increased in all supplemented groups and correlated with DHA intake. Breastmilk DHA was decreased in the regular egg group.[9] Ten mothers of preterm infants (  < 29 weeks gestational age) were given 1200 mg of DHA daily beginning within the first week postpartum and continued for 8 to 12 weeks. A group of 22 mothers who met the same criteria, but without maternal supplementation served as a reference group. The average DHA breastmilk concentration in supplemented mothers increased 5-fold over the baseline value within the first week of supplementation. Breastmilk DHA in the supplemented group was about 12 times higher than in the reference group at 49 days postpartum.[10] A double-blind study randomized 51 mothers of newborn, term infants to receive normal diet (control), normal diet plus 224 mg daily of DHA from algal oil, or normal diet plus 150 grams of fatty fish 3 times weekly. Supplemented mothers maintained consistent DHA levels in colostrum, transitional and mature milk. Mothers on normal diets had a decrease in DHA from colostrum to mature milk. The amount in mature milk was significantly less than that in the milk of supplemented mothers.[11]Mothers who donated milk to a milk bank were randomized to receive either single-cell algal oil capsules equivalent to 1 gram of DHA (n = 6), daily or placebo capsules (n = 7). Mothers in both groups had DHA intake lower than recommended at baseline. The DHA content of milk increased in supplemented mothers. The milk of supplemented mothers provided a sufficient amount of DHA for preterm infant, but not the milk of unsupplemented mothers.[12] Eighty-two nursing mothers who were 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were randomly assigned to take placebo, 200 mg or 800 mg DHA supplements daily each morning with food for 6 weeks. Mothers supplied a mid-nursing breastmilk sample before starting the supplementation and once weekly for 6 weeks. Compared to mothers who received a placebo, breastmilk levels of DHA were 50% higher for mothers who took 200 mg of DHA daily and 123% higher for mothers who took 800 mg DHA daily.[13] One hundred ten mothers were randomly assigned to receive either a control drink (n = 54) or a drink (n = 56) containing fish oil with 72 mg of EPA and 320 mg/dL of DHA daily in two doses during pregnancy and lactation. Breastmilk samples were obtained at birth (colostrum) and at the first second and fourth month postpartum. The content of DHA and EPA as well as n-3-polyunsaturated fats were higher in the milk of supplemented mothers at all time points.[14] Infant Levels: Five nursing mothers were supplemented with fish oil containing 1080 mg of EPA and 720 mg of DHA daily for 21 days, beginning at 2 weeks postpartum. The infants' average erythrocyte content of EPA increased by 636% and docosapentaenoic acid increased by 260% on day 21 compared to baseline. The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids decreased significantly by 22%. DHA content was increased only slightly, but the difference was not statistically significant.[7] New mothers intending to breastfeed for at least 12 weeks were randomized to receive placebo (n = 12) or algal-derived DHA in a dose of 0.2 (n = 10), 0.4 (n = 12), 0.9 (n = 10) or 1.3 (n = 8) grams daily starting at day 5 postpartum. At 12 weeks, their breastfed infants had blood samples measured for plasma and erythrocyte DHA-derived phospholipid. The DHA-phospholipid levels increased proportionately up to a milk DHA level of about 0.8% of total milk lipids, then reached a plateau where higher milk DHA concentrations did not further increase infant DHA-phospholipid levels. Infant EPA-phospholipid levels also increase slightly, while omega-6 fatty acid phospholipids decreased.[15] Mothers who were breastfeeding at least 75% were randomized to receive supplements of either high-DHA algal oil (n = 6), high-DHA eggs (n = 6), low EPA fish oil (n = 6) or regular eggs (n = 6) beginning at 2 weeks postpartum. Supplementation provided doses of   <  230 mg, 170 mg, 260 mg and   < 35 mg daily of DHA, respectively. After 6 weeks of supplementation, infant plasma DHA-phospholipid was increased in all supplemented groups, with the highest in the alga oil group. DHA increased only slightly in the regular egg group.[9] Ten mothers of preterm infants (  < 29 weeks gestational age) were given 1200 mg of DHA daily beginning within the first week postpartum and continued for 8 to 12 weeks. A group of 22 mothers who met the same criteria, but without maternal supplementation served as a reference group. Infants were exclusively fed their mother's breastmilk if possible, but some were partially formula fed. At 49 days of age, the infants whose mothers were given DHA supplementation received an estimated 55 mg/kg daily of DHA and the reference group infants received 7 mg/kg daily of DHA.[10] Eighty-two nursing mothers who were 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were randomly assigned to take placebo, 200 mg or 800 mg DHA supplements daily each morning with food for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks of supplementation of their mothers, breastfed infants' plasma DHA increased by 71% and 101% for the infants of low- and high-dose supplements, respectively, compared to the placebo group. The plasma omega 6:3 ratios were lower in the infants of supplemented mothers.[13] One hundred ten mothers were randomly assigned to receive either a control drink (n = 54) or a drink (n = 56) containing fish oil with 72 mg of EPA and 320 mg/dL of DHA daily in two doses during pregnancy and lactation. Infants were breastfed, but the extent was not stated. At 2.5 months of life, DHA, n-3 and C24:1 -9 polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher in the plasma and erythrocyte membranes of the infants of supplemented mothers. EPA levels were also higher in the plasma of the infants whose mothers were supplemented.[14]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Willow (Salix sp.) bark contains salicylic acid and its derivative salicin. Willow bark has no specific lactation-related uses. It is traditionally used to treat fever and inflammatory conditions, but it also is found in some weight loss products. After salicylate or salicin ingestion, salicylic acid is excreted into breastmilk. The excretion of salicylate into breastmilk increases disproportionately as the maternal dosage increases. Long-term, high-dose maternal aspirin ingestion probably caused metabolic acidosis in one breastfed infant. Reye's syndrome is associated with aspirin administration to infants with viral infections, but the risk of Reye's syndrome from salicylate in breastmilk is unknown.

    drug_levels: "Milk levels have not been measured after maternal ingestion of willow bark or salicin, but have been measured after aspirin and sodium salicylate ingestion. All of these products result in salicylic acid in the blood and milk; however, some studies have not measured salicylate metabolites in breastmilk that may be hydrolyzed in the infant's gut and absorbed as salicylate.[1] Maternal Levels: Milk and blood levels of the salicylate metabolites of aspirin were determined in 8 lactating women following oral administration of 1 g of aspirin. Peak salicylic acid milk levels averaging 2.4 mg/L occurred 3 hours after the dose. Milk contents of salicyluric acid were greater than those of salicylic acid; a mean peak level of 10.2 mg/L was reached after 9 hours, and averaged 4.4 mg/L 24 hours after the dose. Total salicylate and metabolite levels were 5.1 mg/L at 3 hours, 9.9 mg/L at 6 hours, 11.2 mg/L at 9 hours and 10.2 mg/L at 12 hours after the dose. Acid labile conjugates were less than 0.2 mg/L.[2] Using an average salicylate plus salicylurate level over the first 12 hours, a fully breastfed infant would receive an average of 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.Six nursing mothers who were 2 to 8 months postpartum (average 5 months) were given aspirin doses of 500, 1000 and 1500 mg of aspirin orally on 3 separate occasions. Peak breastmilk salicylate levels were 5.8 mg/L, 15.8 mg/L, and 38.8 mg/L, respectively. Salicylate metabolites were not measured. The time of the peak salicylate levels occurred between 2 and 6 hours after ingestion, with little variation in levels over time. The disproportionate increase in milk levels as the dose increased was attributed to nonlinear metabolism and protein binding.[3] Two women given aspirin 454 mg orally had peak salicylate milk levels of about 1 mg/L 1 hour after the dose. The authors estimated that about 0.1% of the mothers' total dose would appear in breastmilk in 48 hours.[4] However, salicylate metabolites were not measured in milk. A woman who was breastfeeding a 4-month-old was taking long-term aspirin therapy in dosages ranging from 2 to 5.9 g daily. During this therapy, milk was obtained 4 hours after a 650 mg dose and just before taking a dose of 975 mg. The trough milk salicylate level was 2 mg/L and a peak level of 10 mg/L occurred 3 hours after the dose. Salicylate levels ranged from 4 to 7 mg/L over the 5 hours after the peak.[5] Using the peak level from this study, a fully breastfed infant would receive about 10% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of salicylate. The assay method used should have measured both salicylate and metabolites in milk. Infant Levels: Four nursing mothers were given oral sodium salicylate in a dose of 20 mg/kg. Their exclusively breastfed infants ranged from 23 to 43 days of age. The infants' urine was collected until salicylate excretion was complete and found to contain 0.18 to 0.36% of the maternal dose, primarily as salicyluric acid.[1] A 9-week-old infant who was born at 36 weeks gestation was receiving about 50% breastmilk and 50% formula. The infant's mother was taking 2.4 g of aspirin daily and the infant's serum contained 65 mg/L of salicylate.[6]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A 16-day-old breastfed infant developed metabolic acidosis with a salicylate serum level of 240 mg/L and salicylate metabolites in the urine. The mother was taking 3.9 g/day of aspirin for arthritis, and salicylate in breastmilk probably caused the infant's illness, but the possibility of direct administration to the infant could not be ruled out.[7] Thrombocytopenia, fever, anorexia and petechiae occurred in a 5-month-old breastfed infant 5 days after her mother started taking aspirin for fever. One week after recovery, the infant was given a single 125 mg dose of aspirin and the platelet count dropped once again. The original symptoms were probably caused by salicylate in breastmilk.[8]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Beta-carotene is a plant pigment that is converted into vitamin A in the body. Maternal vitamin A requirements are increased during lactation, but there are no specific guidelines for increased beta-carotene intake or indications for high-dose supplementation in nursing mothers. Typical beta-carotene intake in a Western diet is 6 to 8 mg daily. Beta-carotene is a normal component of human colostrum and mature milk, where it contributes to antioxidant defenses in the neonate.[1] Average concentrations are 1.12 mg/L and 230 mcg/L, respectively, in the Unites States.[2] Beta-carotene supplementation during pregnancy and for 6 months postpartum in nursing mothers with poor diets in a resource-poor setting reduced the number of days of illness in the mothers,[3] but does not reduce infant morbidity or mortality according to another study.[4] The bioavailability of beta-carotene is dependent on the fat content of the meal and the form in which it is administered, with synthetic pharmaceutical forms having the best bioavailability. High-dose beta-carotene supplements lead to a slow increase in breastmilk beta-carotene concentrations, with an accumulation half-life of about 9 days. Levels drop towards baseline slowly over several weeks after discontinuation. In general, beta-carotene is well tolerated, although excessive maternal intake of beta-carotene can lead to a harmless, reversible discoloration of the breastfed infant's skin.[5] In HIV-infected women, high-dose beta-carotene plus vitamin A supplementation increases the rate of HIV viral shedding into breastmilk and increases HIV infection in breastfed infants, although the mortality rate over the first 2 years of life is not increased.[6][7] The viral shedding may be a result of an increase in subclinical mastitis caused by beta-carotene.[8] Beta-carotene concentration in breastmilk is not affected by refrigeration, freezing, or low-temperature microwaving. The concentration does decrease when milk passes through a tube feeding system, regardless of light exposure.[9]<br><br>Dietary supplements do not require extensive pre-marketing approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.

    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Healthy nursing mothers in the United States were given either 60 mg (n = 6) or 210 mg (n = 6) of beta-carotene as capsules (Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, NJ) as a single dose. Both doses increased breastmilk beta-carotene levels to a similar extent, with peak concentrations of around 1.1 mcg/L of lipid occurring 2 to 3 days after the dose. Mothers with higher baseline beta-carotene levels had higher peak concentrations.[10] Healthy nursing mothers in the United States were given either 7 doses of a placebo (n = 4) or of an algae-derived beta-carotene supplement containing 64 mg of all-trans beta-carotene and 69 mg 9-cis beta-carotene (Henkel Corp., LaGrange, Il). Foremilk samples of breastmilk were obtained daily for 8 days and again at 1 month after the first dose. All-trans beta-carotene levels in milk increased to about 2.1 mg/L of whole milk after 5 days of supplementation and further increased only slightly by day 8. Levels were still elevated above baseline at 1 month. Milk levels of 9-cis beta-carotene increased steadily from baseline to day 8, with a much lower peak value of about 40 ng/L. The lower value was possibly the result of isomerization of 9-cis beta-carotene to all-trans beta-carotene.[11]Five healthy exclusively breastfeeding mothers over 1 month postpartum (average 279 days postpartum) in the United States were given 30 mg of beta-carotene as capsules (Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. Nutley, NJ) daily for 28 days with high-fat yogurt. Milk beta-carotene levels increased an average of 6.4 fold over the 28-day period, with an average maximum concentration of about 200 mcg/L. The accumulation half-life of beta-carotene in milk was 9 days, which was almost twice a long as the accumulation half-life in serum. At one month after the end of supplementation, milk levels remained about double of baseline levels.[12] Twenty-one postpartum women in the United States received either water-dispersible beadlets of beta-carotene in capsules (n = 11), which were assayed to contain 31 to 35 mg of beta-carotene and 1.2 mg of alpha-carotene, or an identical placebo (n = 10) daily for 4 weeks starting on 4 days postpartum. During the 4 weeks of the study, there was no significant change in average breastmilk beta-carotene concentrations, whereas those in the placebo group had a decrease in average beta-carotene milk concentrations which as not statistically significant. Differences between this study and previous studies was suggested to be caused by differences in subjects' milkfat levels which were lower in this study.[13] A study compared 4 groups of women in West Java, Indonesia who received supplementation during pregnancy until delivery. All groups received 30 mg of iron and 0.4 mg of folic acid daily. Experimental groups received either beta-carotene 4.5 mg daily as a water-soluble granulate, zinc 30 mg daily, beta-carotene 4.5 mg plus zinc 30 mg daily, or only the iron and folic acid as a control group. Milk samples were collected during the first and sixth months postpartum. The milk beta-carotene level was significantly different from the control group only in the 6-month sample of the zinc plus beta-carotene group. The vitamin A status of the mothers and their infants was also better in the group that received beta-carotene and zinc.[14]A study of 866 HIV-infected women in Tanzania were enrolled in a study to receive 1 of 4 supplements during pregnancy and lactation. Groups received either multivitamins, multivitamins plus vitamin A and beta-carotene, vitamin A and beta-carotene alone, or placebo daily. The beta-carotene dose was 30 mg. At 24 months of age, the multivitamin-supplemented group's infants had significantly better growth parameters than the other groups.[15] A study of HIV-infected women in Tanzania were enrolled in a study to receive 1 of 4 supplements during pregnancy and lactation. Groups receive either multivitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin B6, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folic acid), multivitamins plus vitamin A and beta-carotene, vitamin A and beta-carotene alone, or placebo daily. The beta-carotene dose was 30 mg. Breastmilk samples were collected at delivery and at 3-month intervals thereafter. Average breastmilk beta-carotene concentrations in the beta-carotene supplemented groups were consistently about 10-fold higher than in the groups that received no beta-carotene at any time up to 1 year of age.[16] Twelve women were given carrot paste and 14 were given tomato paste with a high-fat meal once daily for 3 days. The carrot supplement contained 15 mg of all-trans beta-carotene and the tomato supplement contained 15 mg of all-trans lycopene. Breastmilk beta-carotene levels nearly doubled after 3 days of supplementation, whereas lycopene levels increased by about 15% one day after the 3 days of supplementation.[17] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A nursing mother was eating 2 to 3 pounds of carrots a week as raw and cooked carrots. The mother's skin was yellow in color, but her sclera were clear. At 2 months of age, her breastfed infant was diagnosed as having jaundice because of a yellow coloration of the skin. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the infant's skin returned to a normal color. The mother continued her diet and examination of the maternal serum found elevated levels of beta-carotene which was probably the cause of her infant's skin discoloration.[5] HIV-infected women in Tanzania received 1 of 4 supplements during pregnancy and lactation in a series of studies. Groups received either multivitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin B6, niacin, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folic acid), multivitamins plus vitamin A and beta-carotene, vitamin A and beta-carotene alone, or placebo daily. The beta-carotene dose was 30 mg. At 24 months of age, the multivitamin-supplemented group's infants had significantly better growth parameters than the other groups.[15] One study found that the infants of mothers supplemented with vitamin A and beta-carotene had a higher rate of HIV transmission than those supplemented with multivitamins alone or placebo.[6] After 6 months postpartum, women who received vitamin A plus beta-carotene had greater shedding of the HIV virus into breastmilk than women who had not; multivitamins without vitamin A and beta-carotene did not increase viral shedding.[6] Beta-carotene appeared to have a shedding effect that was independent of vitamin A.[7] One possible explanation comes from another similar study in which those who received vitamin A plus beta-carotene alone had a 45% increased risk of severe subclinical mastitis and those who received multivitamins plus vitamin A and beta-carotene had a 29% increased risk of severe subclinical mastitis.[8]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Phosphate is a normal constituent of breastmilk. Phosphate concentrations have not been measured in breastmilk after large maternal doses of sodium phosphate, such a 30 gram oral dose for pre-procedural bowel evacuation. However, the added phosphate in breastmilk is likely to be only about 130 mg over 24 hours in this situation. The increase from a typical dose of a rectal enema would be considerably less than this amount. Breastmilk sodium concentration is tightly regulated, and will not be affected. It is probably not necessary to suspend breastfeeding after the use of oral sodium phosphate solutions given once or twice for bowel evacuation before a procedure, but if there is concern, suspension of nursing for 24 hours after a dose should result in negligible increase in phosphate ingestion by the infant. Use of a phosphate rectal enema by a nursing mother would require no special precautions."
    drug_levels: "Phosphate is a normal constituent of breastmilk.[1][2] Infants normally receive about 130 mg of inorganic phosphate daily from breastmilk.[2] Maternal Levels: Administration of a 30 gram dose of oral sodium phosphate solution (e.g., Visicol) approximately doubles the maternal serum phosphate concentration, with serum concentrations returning to baseline about 24 hours after the dose.[3][4] Assuming breastmilk phosphate concentration also doubles, the increased phosphate dose to the infant would be only 130 mg for one day. Administration of a phosphate enema (2 Fleet Enemas, containing a total of 14 grams of sodium phosphate dibasic and 38 grams of sodium phosphate monobasic) to 33 subjects increased serum phosphate by an average of about 25% (range 0.1 to 2.5 mg/dL).[5] In one other patient, a phosphate enema (Practo Clyss 120, containing a total of 7.2 grams of sodium phosphate dibasic and 19.2 grams of sodium phosphate monobasic) increased serum phosphate by 35% (by 0.8 mmol/L) after a single dose.[6] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."

Mothers should exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first 6 months of life; breastfeeding with complementary feeding should continue through 12 months of life. The first choice regimen for nursing mothers is tenofovir, efavirenz and either lamivudine or emtricitabine. If these drugs are unavailable, alternative regimens include: 1) zidovudine, lamivudine and efavirenz; 2) zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine; or 3) tenofovir, nevirapine and either lamivudine or emtricitabine.

Since only extensive application of the most potent corticosteroids may cause systemic effects in the mother, it is unlikely that short-term application of topical corticosteroids  would pose a risk to the breastfed infant by passage into breastmilk.

It is particularly important to ensure that the infant's skin does not come into direct contact with the areas of skin that have been treated. Only the lower potency corticosteroids  should be used on the nipple or areola where the infant could directly ingest the drugs from the skin; fluocinonide should be avoided on the nipple.[1] Only water-miscible cream or gel products should be applied to the breast because ointments may expose the infant to high levels of mineral paraffins via licking.[2] Any topical corticosteroid should be wiped off thoroughly prior to nursing if it is being applied to the breast or nipple area."

Milk samples were collected at 10 weeks postpartum before insertion and 6 weeks after insertion of the devices from 21 women in the first study group, 22 in the second study group and 20 women in the control group. Milk copper concentrations ranged between 0.25 and 0.31 mcg/gram of milk in the various groups before and after insertion.

There were no statistically significant differences between groups with regard to infant anthropometric parameters and child health, except a lower incidence of child illness after 6 months in the lynestrenol group.[4] Three hundred twenty lactating women were randomized to either a copper-containing IUD (Copper T380A; n =157) or to an IUD containing levonorgestrel (Mirena; n =163). Follow-up of infants for 1 year found no differences in growth and development or in duration of breastfeeding.[5] A study compared the performance of a copper-containing IUD (Copper T 380A; n = 122), progesterone vaginal rings (n = 187), an oral progestin-only contraceptive (lynestrenol 500 mcg; n = 117), and levonorgestrel implants (Norplant; n = 120) in lactating women. After the first year of use, none of the methods affected the rate of infant growth.[6] In a multicenter study, women who received a (Copper T 380A; N = 734) intrauterine device were compared to women who received a vaginal ring that released about 10 mg daily of progesterone (N = 802) beginning at day 29 to 63 postpartum.

The authors also noted that they had seen 12 women with galactorrhea who were using a copper IUD, although they did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. None of the study patients had galactorrhea.[8] A 30-year-old woman had been using a copper IUD (Gravigard) for 19 months when she noted spontaneous galactorrhea, mostly from the left breast. Thyroid function and basal serum prolactin levels were normal and a brain tumor was ruled out. Three months later, the IUD was removed and milk production stopped 7 months after removal. The patient used no IUD for 3 months, then the copper IUD was replaced. Mild spontaneous lactation began 3 days after IUD placement, mainly from the right breast. The patient was taking no medications that would cause galactorrhea. The galactorrhea was probably caused by the IUD.[9] Eighty-four women had 6 subdermal implants containing 100 mg each of progesterone inserted between days 30 to 35 postpartum as a contraceptive. Compared to women who received either a placebo or a Copper T intrauterine device, no difference was found in the breastfeeding rates during the first 9 months postpartum. At 1 year postpartum, more women in the Copper T group were breastfeeding than in the progesterone or placebo groups.[10]An open-label, two-center, randomized study in breastfeeding women compared a copper-containing IUD (Multiload Cu250) with an oral progestin-only contraceptive (lynestrenol 500 mcg). There were no statistically significant differences between groups with regard to the amount of milk production or number of daily breastfeedings.[4] A study compared the performance of a copper-containing IUD (Copper T 380A; n = 122), progesterone vaginal rings (n = 187), an oral progestin-only contraceptive (lynestrenol 500 mcg; n = 117), and levonorgestrel implants (Norplant; n = 120) in lactating women. After the first year of use, none of the methods affected breastfeeding performance. Users of the progestin-only methods experienced a period of lactational amenorrhea 4 to 5 months longer than did users of Copper T or untreated women.[6] In a multicenter study, women who received a (Copper T 380A; N = 734) intrauterine device were compared to women who received a vaginal ring that released about 10 mg daily of progesterone (N = 802) beginning at day 29 to 63 postpartum. No differences were found in the rate of breastfeeding between the 2 groups over the first year postpartum.[7]A nonblinded, nonrandomized study compared a copper-containing IUD (Multiload Cu375; n = 40) to oral desogestrel 75 mcg daily (n = 42) begun 28 to 56 days postpartum for contraception. During the 7-month trial period, 1 woman dropped out of the trial because of diminished lactation compared with none in the IUD group. At the end of the first and fourth treatment cycle, there were no differences in the amount of milk produced between the desogestrel and IUD groups. No differences in triglyceride, protein or lactose content of milk were found at the end of 1, 4, and 7 cycles of therapy.[11]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Because sevelamer is not orally absorbed, sevelamer is unlikely to reach the breastmilk or adversely affect the breastfed infant after maternal administration. A suspension of sevelamer has been added directly to breastmilk to lower the phosphorus concentration of milk. This could be a useful maneuver for breastmilk use in infants with renal impairment; however, clinical use has not been reported. In addition to lowering average phosphorus content by 65% to over 80%, the calcium content of breastmilk was reduced by almost as much and the casein content also decreased somewhat. With sevelamer hydrochloride, the chloride content increased by 60% and the pH changed from 6.8 to 7.8, although pH appears to rebound over time.[1][2] Addition of large amounts of sevelamer to artificial formula also lowers the copper, magnesium, manganese, potassium, sulfur and zinc concentrations by about 20%.[3] Similar reductions might occur with breastmilk."

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Most sources consider breastfeeding to be contraindicated during maternal antineoplastic drug therapy, although antimetabolites such as thioguanine appear to pose the least risk to breastfed infants.[1] Thioguanine levels in milk are reportedly low. Thioguanine nucleosides are active intracellular metabolites of azathioprine and have been measured in breastmilk and in infant serum following maternal use of azathioprine as an immunosuppressant. Although amounts in milk were low in breastmilk and mostly undetectable in infant serum, relatively low dosages of azathioprine were used. After high-dose chemotherapy, it might be possible to breastfeed safely during intermittent therapy with an appropriate period of breastfeeding abstinence. Although no data are available to determine an appropriate period to withhold breastfeeding, the drug's terminal half-life suggests that withholding breastfeeding for 4 days may be sufficient. Chemotherapy may adversely affect the normal microbiome and chemical makeup of breastmilk.[2]"
    drug_levels: "Maternal Levels: Four women receiving an immunomodulator to treat inflammatory bowel disease had metabolite levels measured in milk during the first 6 weeks postpartum. The abstract does not mention the specific drug and dose being taken, but the azathioprine metabolite 6-thioguanine nucleosides (6-TGNs) were measured. Although therapeutic levels were found in maternal serum, 6-TGNs was undetectable (  < 123 mcg/L) in milk (time of collection not stated).[3] One woman received thioguanine for inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy and lactation. She was receiving thioguanine 0.7 mg/kg daily in divided doses to treat colitis. Her breastmilk level at delivery was 48 nanomol/L (8.03 mcg/L).[4] Infant Levels. Four infants were breastfed (3 exclusively, 1 rarely received formula) during maternal use of azathioprine orally in dosages of 1.2 to 2.1 mg/kg daily. All of the mothers and infants had the wild type TPMT *1/*1 genotype and all of the mothers had normal enzyme activity. At 3 to 3.5 months of age, all of the infants had undetectable blood levels of 6-TGNs.[5] Three infants whose mothers were taking azathioprine for inflammatory bowel disease (n = 2) or systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 1) were breastfed during maternal use of azathioprine. Azathioprine doses were 100 mg (plus prednisolone), 150 mg (plus infliximab) and 175 mg daily. In 1 infant, thioguanine was low, but detectable in blood at 3 days of age; at 3 weeks of age, thioguanine was not detectable. In another infant, thioguanine was undetectable at 3 weeks of age. Neither assay limits nor specific maternal doses were stated in the published abstract.[6]A woman began taking azathioprine 100 mg (1.4 mg/kg) daily for Crohn's disease while breastfeeding (extent not stated) her 3-month-old infant. After 8 days and 3 months of maternal therapy, 6-TGNs were measured, although breastfeeding had been tapered to zero by 3 months. On both occasions, 6-TGNs were not detectable in the blood of the infant. The assay limit was not stated.[7]"

Maternal use of oral narcotics during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, central nervous system depression and even death. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral oxymorphone to a few days at low dosages, with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Breastmilk levels of nitroprusside sodium have not been measured after exogenous administration. Because of its short half-life of 2 minutes, it is unlikely to appear in breastmilk. However, its toxic metabolite, thiocyanate, is excreted into milk and can be directly toxic to the infant as well as inhibiting iodide transport into breastmilk. Cyanide is another toxic metabolite of nitroprusside that may enter breastmilk. An alternate drug is therefore preferred, during breastfeeding. If use of nitroprusside sodium is unavoidable, the mother should refrain from breastfeeding."
    drug_levels: "Nitroprusside is converted with a half life of about 2 minutes to cyanide and then to thiocyanate in the body. Both of these metabolites have longer half-lives: 7.3 hours for cyanide and an estimated 3 days to 2 weeks for thiocyanate.[1][2] Maternal Levels: An older study found that thiocyanate passed into human breastmilk in concentrations from 27% to 50% of maternal serum levels.[3] A later study found milk levels to range from 16% to 42% of maternal plasma levels.[4] A 2004 study found values ranging from 42% to 82%,[1] while a more recent study reported fractional excretion of thiocyanate that ranged between 1.4-14.4%.[5] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Several studies have found that breastmilk iodine levels are inversely related to the mothers' blood thiocyanate levels, probably through inhibition of the Na/I symporter by thiocyanate.[6][7][8][9] However, a recent study failed to demonstrate such a correlation. The authors felt that the effect of thiocyanate on iodine transport may be less pronounced than previously reported.[5] These low breastmilk iodine levels might pose a risk of hypothyroidism to  breastfed infants whose mothers have low iodine intake.[5][6][7][8][9]"

After delivery, patients in all groups received an infusion of oxytocin 30 international units in 1 L of saline, and 0.2 mg of methylergonovine if they were not hypertensive. Fentanyl 1 to 1.5 mcg/kg was administered after delivery to the general anesthesia group.

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Maternal use of oral narcotics during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, central nervous system (CNS) depression and even death. Like codeine, pharmacogenetics probably plays a role in the extent of CNS depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics. Dihydrocodeine possibly caused severe respiratory depression in one newborn infant whose mother was taking the drug for cough. Once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of hydromorphone to a few days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring. If the baby shows signs of increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness, a physician should be contacted immediately. Because there is little published experience with dihydrocodine during breastfeeding, an alternate drug may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant."

Entry into the study was based on maternal reports of insufficient milk supply and only mothers were blinded to the treatment. No maternal counseling on breastfeeding was provided. The principal finding of the study was that the volume of supplementary feedings decreased significantly from an average of 292 mL daily to 40 mL/day in the treatment group and decreased a statistically insignificant amount in the placebo group. No differences in infant weight gains were noted before and after treatment between the two groups. Twenty-one of the 30 mothers receiving the active drug were able to completely breastfeed their infants by the end of the study. Mothers who received the active product subjectively felt that they had a better milk supply and were more satisfied with nursing at the end of the study.[4]"

The average milk level was 19 mcg/L which resulted in an infant dosage of 2.9 mcg/kg daily or 0.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[1] The same authors reported a nursing mother who was taking methylphenidate, but it is unclear if this patient is one of those reported above. The mother was taking 40 mg twice daily, 5 days/week for 5.5 weeks prior to testing, but for 7 consecutive days immediately before collecting blood and milk samples after a morning dose of 40 mg. The average milk level of methylphenidate over the 24 hours after the dose was 15.4 mcg/L. The infant was calculated to receive 2.3 mcg/kg daily which was 0.2% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[2] A woman who was 11 months postpartum was taking oral immediate-release methylphenidate 5 mg in the morning and 10 mg at noon. The drug was undetectable (  < 0.3 mcg/L) before the morning dose and 21 hours after the noon dose. Three other levels ranged from1.7 to 3.8 mcg/L. The authors estimated that a fully breastfed infant would receive a dose of 0.38 mcg/kg daily or 0.16% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage.[3]A woman was taking 72 mg daily of slow-release methylphenidate. The drug was undetectable (assay limit not stated) in breastmilk at 6 to 12 months postpartum.[4] Infant Levels: Methylphenidate blood levels were measured in 2 breastfed infants.

However, fosphenytoin is rapidly metabolized in the body to the active drug phenytoin. Because of the low levels of phenytoin in breastmilk, amounts ingested by the infant are small and usually cause no difficulties in breastfed infants when used alone except for rare idiosyncratic reactions. Breastfeeding during phenytoin monotherapy does not appear to adversely affect infant growth or development, and breastfed infants had slightly higher IQs and enhanced verbal abilities than nonbreastfed infants at 6 years of age in one study.[1] Combination therapy with sedating anticonvulsants or psychotropics may result in infant sedation or withdrawal reactions. In one case report, maternal phenytoin dosage requirements decreased as breastfeeding was discontinued.[2]"
    drug_levels: "Fosphenytoin is rapidly metabolized to phenytoin, formaldehyde and phosphate after administration. Information on phenytoin during breastfeeding is listed below. In published reports of anticonvulsant use during breastfeeding, most women were taking a combination of anticonvulsants. Some other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) stimulate the metabolism of other drugs including anticonvulsants, whereas others (e.g., valproic acid) inhibit the metabolism of other drugs. Therefore, the relationship of the maternal dosage to the concentration in breastmilk can be quite variable, making calculation of the weight-adjusted percentage of maternal dosage less meaningful than for other drugs in this database. Maternal Levels: Two women were taking phenytoin plus phenobarbital orally. In one woman taking phenytoin 30 mg 3 times daily, milk phenytoin levels were fairly constant during the day, averaging 0.5 mg/L (ranging 0.4 to 0.7 mg/L) at 6 am, 10 am and 8 pm between days 3 and 7 postpartum. In the other woman taking 100 mg 3 times daily, milk levels averaged 0.65, 1 and 1.1 mg/L at 6 am, 10 am and 8 pm, respectively, between days 5 and 11 postpartum.[1] Two women were taking phenytoin 300 mg daily (dosage details not reported) during pregnancy and postpartum. In one, milk levels ranged from 1.2 to 2.2 mg/L at various times on days 4 to 6 postpartum. The highest levels were reported on day 6. In the other, levels ranged from 1 to 2.6 mg/L on days 1 to 4 postpartum and was 1.3 mg/L on day 33 postpartum.[3]A woman was taking phenytoin 100 mg 3 times daily. Breastmilk levels varied during the day, with a level of 1.4 mg/L before the first morning dose and a level of 4.2 mg/L 2 hours after the last dose of the day.[4] In a woman taking phenytoin 500 mg daily in 2 divided doses 12 hours apart, breastmilk phenytoin levels were 0.58 mg/L 3 hours after the morning dose and 0.26 mg/L 1 hour before the evening dose.[5] A woman usually maintained on phenytoin 300 mg daily was given a single oral dose of 100 mg of phenytoin at 7 am and no other doses on that day. The trough level of 1.2 mg/L from the previous day's dosage occurred one hour after the dose and a peak milk level of 4.5 mg/L occurred 4 hours after the dose. From 1 pm until 8 am the next morning, milk levels fluctuated between 0.5 and 1 mg/L.[6] Eight phenytoin breastmilk levels were measured between days 3 and 32 postpartum at unstated times after the dose in an unstated number of women who were taking phenytoin and other anticonvulsants in unstated dosages. Phenytoin milk levels averaged 0.8 mg/L (range 0.5 to 1.4 mg/L), while maternal serum levels averaged 4.5 mg/L[7] A mother who was taking phenytoin 200 mg twice daily had breastmilk phenytoin levels measured 5 times during days 2 to 4 postpartum. Milk levels ranged from trace to 2 mg/L.[8] Two mothers taking phenytoin during pregnancy and postpartum had breastmilk levels measured during the first week postpartum. One who was taking 300 mg daily had a milk level of 2.7 mg/L and the other who was taking 200 mg daily had a milk level of 1.7 mg/L[9] Phenytoin was measured in breastmilk in 5 women. In one taking 100 mg daily, a breastmilk levels of 0.76 mg/L was found 3 days postpartum. In 4 others taking 300 mg daily, milk levels on several occasions mostly during the first week postpartum ranged from 0.41 to 1.3 mg/L. Most of the levels were in the range of 0.5 to 0.6 mg/L.[10][11] It is estimated that a breastfed infant would receive between 0.5 and 8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage of phenytoin in breastmilk.[12] Infant Levels: Six breastfed infants whose mothers were taking phenytoin 200 to 400 mg daily had serum phenytoin levels measured between 1 and 3 months of age. Only 2 of the 6 infants were found to have detectable serum levels during breastfeeding; the levels were 126 and 197 mcg/L. Only 1 infant had a measurable serum level of 4-hydroxyphenytoin of 118 mcg/L.[13]"
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "A mother was taking phenobarbital 390 mg daily and phenytoin 400 mg daily during pregnancy and postpartum. Her infant was drowsy at birth, refused to suck and was given partial formula feeding. At 5 days of age, her infant was admitted to the hospital pale and collapsed with bruising, bleeding, and a decreased hemoglobin, thought to be due to methemoglobinemia. Breastfeeding was discontinued and the infant was given a transfusion which rapidly improved her condition. On day 10, the mother resumed breastfeeding the infant. Within 24 hours the infant was extremely sedated and refused to suck and was fed breastmilk with a spoon. The sedation persisted for 2 days until breastmilk was discontinued permanently because of a return of methemoglobinemia. The extreme sedation was probably due to phenobarbital in the milk and the methemoglobinemia was probably caused by the phenytoin.[14] One clinician reported that the breastfed infants of 28 mothers who were taking phenytoin 100 to 200 mg 3 times daily had no adverse reactions including drowsiness or lethargy.[15]No adverse effects were noted in the breastfed neonates of 2 mothers who were taking phenytoin 300 mg daily.[3] A 10-week-old breastfed infant whose mother was taking clemastine, phenytoin and carbamazepine was drowsy, refused to feed, was irritable, and had high-pitched crying.[16] These side effects were possibly caused by clemastine in breastmilk, but the other drugs could also have contributed. A probable case of drug-induced drowsiness occurred in a newborn whose mother was taking primidone, carbamazepine and phenytoin (dosages not stated). At day 30, breastfeeding was discontinued because of the drowsiness that occurred after each feeding and poor weight gain. The same group of researchers found that 15 partially breastfed infants whose mothers were taking various anticonvulsants, including phenytoin, gained weight at a slower rate during the first 5 days postpartum than did 75 infants of epileptic mothers who bottle fed or control mothers taking no medications.[17] Drowsiness, pallor and feeding difficulties in a 2-week-old were possibly caused by primidone and phenytoin in breastmilk. Possible drug-related drowsiness, pallor and feeding difficulties were reported in a 4-day-old whose mother was taking primidone, phenobarbital, phenytoin and sulthiame.[18] Although phenytoin might have contributed to these outcomes, it is more likely that they were due primarily to the more sedating anticonvulsants, primidone and phenobarbital. Two breastfed infants (one full, one partial) whose mothers took phenytoin during pregnancy and postpartum became hyperexcitable when their serum phenytoin dropped to unmeasurable levels at 3 to 6 weeks of age.[19] In a long-term study on infants exposed to anticonvulsants during breastfeeding, no difference in average intelligence quotient at 3 years of age was found between infants who were breastfed (n = 17) a median of 6 months and those not breastfed (n = 23) when their mothers were taking phenytoin.[20] At 6 years of age, extensive psychological and intelligence testing found no difference between the breastfed and nonbreastfed infants.[1]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "No information is available on the clinical use of fospropofol during breastfeeding. However, fospropofol is rapidly metabolized to propofol in the body. Amounts of propofol in milk are very small and are not expected to be absorbed by the infant. Although one expert panel recommends withholding nursing for an unspecified time after propofol administration,[1] most recommend that breastfeeding can be resumed as soon as the mother has recovered sufficiently from general anesthesia to nurse and that discarding milk is unnecessary.[2][3][4] When a combination of anesthetic agents is used for a procedure, follow the recommendations for the most problematic medication used during the procedure. General anesthesia for cesarean section using propofol as a component for induction may delay the onset of lactation.<br><br>  In one case, milk was noted to be green in color 8 hours after a procedure in which propofol was administered; however, several other medications were also used during the procedure."
    drug_levels: "Fospropofol is rapidly metabolized to propofol, formaldehyde and phosphate after administration. Information on propofol during breastfeeding is listed below. Maternal Levels: Five women who had undergone general anesthesia with propofol intravenously shortly after delivery had colostrum propofol levels measured. All of the women received 2 mg/kg intravenously over 20 seconds at time zero followed by a continuous infusion. In 3 women who received 0.25 to 0.37 mg/kg/minute, propofol was detectable in colostrum, but not quantifiable because of technical difficulties. In a woman who received 0.42 mg/kg/minute for 7 minutes, the highest colostrum level was 1.53 mg/L at 15 minutes after the start of the infusion. Colostrum levels decreased to 0.12 mg/L over the next 8 hours. Another woman who received 0.18 mg/kg/minute for 6 hours, the highest colostrum level was 4.91 mg/L at 30 minutes after the start of the infusion.[5] Four women received a single intravenous bolus dose of propofol 2.5 mg/kg prior to cesarean section. Colostrum levels averaged 0.17 mg/L (range 0.14 to 0.24 mg/L) in 3 of the women 4 hours after the dose and 0.14 mg/L (range 0.089 to 0.19 mg/L) in 4 of the women 8 hours after the dose. In the same report, 3 women received a bolus dose of propofol 2.5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 5 mg/kg/hour. In one patient, colostrum level was 0.33 mg/L at 4 hours after the bolus; a second patient had levels of 0.74 mg/L at 5 hours and 0.048 mg/L at 8 hours after the bolus; a third patient had a colostrum level of 0.036 mg/L at 6 hours after the bolus.[2] Five women who were 6 to 15 weeks postpartum were given a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg of propofol intravenously before undergoing general anesthesia. Several milk samples were collected between 5 and 24 hours after the injection from each woman. The authors estimated that the infants would receive an average of 0.0052 mg/kg in the 24 hours after a single dose of propofol. This corresponds to 0.02% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. The women's milk output following the surgical procedure was less than half of the normal milk output of nursing mothers. The authors concluded that this amount of propofol in milk is unlikely to affect a healthy, term infant.[3] The infants of mothers not undergoing a surgical procedure might receive a greater dose of propofol in breastmilk, but it would be unlikely to be a large dose.A woman received 474 mg of propofol by controlled infusion during a procedure to terminate an ectopic pregnancy. The first milk she pumped 8 hours after the procedure was green in color. Although the authors suspect that propofol was the cause of the discoloration, the woman had also received several other medications during the procedure. Thirty hours later, propofol was detected in a milk sample at a concentration of 24 mcg/L, completely as unconjugated propofol.[6] Two mothers who were breastfeeding their infants were given propofol doses that targeted a serum concentration of 6.5 mcg/L for anesthesia induction. Propofol was stopped as xenon anesthesia was started. One mother received a total of 350 mg of propofol intravenously and had an operative time of 35 minutes. Her milk propofol level was 0.13 mg/L at 300 minutes after extubation. The other mother received a total of 443 mg of propofol intravenously and had an operative time of 35 minutes. Her milk propofol level was 2.78 mg/L at 90 minutes after  extubation and 0.84 mg/L 300 minutes after extubation.[7] Infant Levels: Relevant published information was not found as of the revision date."
    effects_in_breastfed_infants: "Four mothers who were breastfeeding their infants received propofol as part of their general anesthesia for surgical procedures. All patients also received intravenous remifentanil and rocuronium, and inhaled xenon as part of the anesthesia. They were given doses of propofol that targeted a serum concentration of 6.5 mcg/L for induction and stopped as xenon anesthesia was started. Operation times ranged from 35 to 45 minutes. Individual infants were first breastfed as follows: 1.5 hours, 2.8 hours, 4.6 hours, and 5 hours after extubation. No signs of sedation were observed in any of the infants.[7]"
    effects_on_lactation_and_breastmilk: "A randomized study compared the effects of cesarean section using general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, or epidural anesthesia, to normal vaginal delivery on serum prolactin and oxytocin as well as time to initiation of lactation. General anesthesia was performed using propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg for induction, followed by sevoflurane and rocuronium 0.15 mg/kg as needed. Fentanyl 1 to 1.5 mcg/kg was administered after delivery. Patients in the general anesthesia group (n = 21) had higher post-procedure prolactin levels and a longer mean time to lactation initiation (25 hours) than in the other groups (10.8 to 11.8 hours). Postpartum oxytocin levels in the nonmedicated vaginal delivery group were higher than in the general and spinal anesthesia groups.[8]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "Heroin use during breastfeeding has not been systematically studied, but case reports indicate that addiction of the breastfed infant can occur via breastfeeding by heroin-using mothers.[1] Heroin use by breastfeeding mothers can also prevent symptoms of withdrawal in their addicted breastfed infants.[2][3] Use of heroin as a street drug by nursing mothers carries the risk of breastmilk contamination with a variety of possible chemical contaminants that may be present in illicit heroin. Heroin use by a nursing mother is generally considered to be a contraindication to breastfeeding. Mothers who discontinue heroin use and begin methadone or buprenorphine maintenance therapy should be encouraged to breastfeed with ongoing medical support.[4]<br><br>  Heroin (diamorphine) by the intrathecal or epidural route is recommended for analgesia during cesarean section and for postoperative analgesia in the United Kingdom where a standardized pharmaceutical product is commercially available.[5] However, no research on the effect on the breastfed infant or lactation has been published with this use."
    drug_levels: "Heroin (diacetylmorphine) is rapidly metabolized in the body to 6-monoacetylmorphine which is about 6 times more potent than morphine; 6-monoacetylmorphine is further metabolized to morphine. All three drugs contribute to heroin's effects.[6] Maternal Levels: A heroin-addicted mother on methadone maintenance treatment, found a low concentration of morphine (7 mcg/L) in her breastmilk. The presence of morphine possibly indicated recent use of heroin.[7] Infant Levels: A 2-month-old breastfed (extent not stated) infant whose mother admitted to using heroin two days prior was admitted to the hospital. The infant's stomach contents and blood were positive for opiates, but results were not quantified.[8]"

She continued to use the snuff and became addicted. The breastfed infant slept excessively, but when awake would curl up with abdominal cramps and cry continuously until breastfed. When the mother was deprived of the drug, the infant would yawn, sneeze, sweat, cry and have cramps in addition to occasional diarrhea. The mother was arrested and the infant was examined by the prison physician. Upon examination, the infant was \"pale and flabby looking.\" with almost colorless lips and pinpoint pupils that did not react to light. The infant slept for most of a day then awoke with sweating and cramps. The infant was treated with camphorated tincture of opium (paregoric) and tincture of nux vomica three times daily. After 4 days of therapy, the infant reportedly appeared more cheerful and had no more cramps.[1] A 2-month-old breastfed (extent not stated) infant presented to the hospital with irritability and a high-pitched cry. He developed hypertonia and opisthotonus and had an increased respiration and heart rate. Laboratory tests revealed a severe metabolic alkalosis. His mother admitted to using heroin two days prior to admission for the first time since delivery. The infant's stomach contents and blood were positive for opiates as was the breastmilk and urine of the mother. The infant developed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and had two positive sweat tests, indicating cystic fibrosis. The authors attributed the infant's metabolic alkalosis to the profuse sweating from heroin withdrawal in the presence of undiagnosed cystic fibrosis.[8] An 8-year-old girl was brought to a hospital in Iran by her aunt. The girl's mother had used heroin throughout pregnancy and lactation. She continued to breastfeed the child up to the time of admission to prevent heroin withdrawal. The girl had also not been enrolled in school to avoid signs of withdrawal in the child. Both mother and child were treated with buprenorphine for opiate addiction.[3]"

When she switched to using morphine by injection, her milk supply seemed to diminish and she needed to breastfeed more frequently.[1] The amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome with \"copious galactorrhea\" was reported in 3 female heroin addicts in their early 20's. Serum prolactin was not measured, but all had hypoestrogenism and low gonadotropin levels.[12]"

    summary_of_use_during_lactation: "No information is available on the clinical use of elotuzumab during breastfeeding. Because elotuzumab is a large protein molecule with a molecular weight of 148,100, the amount in milk is likely to be very low and absorption is unlikely because it is probably destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract. However, elotuzumab is administered with dexamethasone and lenalidomide, two drugs which also have no information on use in nursing mothers. The manufacturer recommends that women receiving elotuzumab should not breastfeed."
